The Constitutional Court on Tuesday ruled that new home owners are not liable for historical debt taken over from previous owners.Municipalities such as Tshwane, eThekwini and Ekurhuleni &mdash; as well as the cooperative and governance minister &mdash; argued against a landmark high court judgment in 2016, which made a similar ruling.&nbsp; The high court application saw property owners take on Tshwane and Ekurhuleni for cutting municipal services to new home owners who had inherited historical debt.&#8220;The applicants complained that they faced darkness, having no electricity and many other inhumane conditions because they bought property whose previous owners failed to meet their obligations to the municipality,&#8221; the court explained in a media briefing.The municipalities had argued that it was lawful for them to attach and sell a newly purchased property to extract money for debt owed to them.In a unanimous judgment, the court ruled that the provision in Section 118 (3) of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, 2000 is well capable of being interpreted so that the charge does not survive transfer, the court explained.
