There is a rare breed of elder statesmen dominating the domestic league. Last week, one of them reminded the younger brigade that it would take something special to dislodge him as one of the top finishers in the game.At 35 years of age, in a career that has taken him to Moroka Swallows, Orlando Pirates, SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns, Katlego Mashego has been over the mountain and back again.Last week, Mashego displayed all his predatory instincts when he sweetly curled a free kick past Brilliant Khuzwayo for the only goal of the match. Chippa United earned a 1-0 victory and Mashego our gong as this week s Real Makoya.In truth, Chiefs never really pitched up for the game and were subjected to unbearable pressure by the Eastern Cape outfit in a dominating display that thrilled the packed crowd. The cherry on top was Mashego s free kick. I have scored better goals, said the man known as Mahoota, but last week s goal was also special. It might have taken a deflection, but they all count all the same and I m glad it gave us a confidence boost going into the new season. Mashego s presence also gives coach Dan Malesela confidence that, when the chips are down, he s got a veteran soldier on the field who can rally the troops. The wily Mashego is maturing like good wine and, despite being considered long in the tooth by some, he keeps on going, thumbing his nose at his detractors.&nbsp;
