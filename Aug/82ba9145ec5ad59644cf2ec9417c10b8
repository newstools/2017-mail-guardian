Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola expressed fears that his team&#8217;s goal-scoring problems remain an issue after they drew 1-1 with Everton in their opening Premier League home game.Wayne Rooney put Everton ahead in the 35th minute on Monday and City had Kyle Walker controversially sent off before half-time, but the hosts hit back to level through substitute Raheem Sterling&#8217;s volley eight minutes from time.City regularly struggled to kill teams off last season, drawing seven home games in the league, and when asked if his side&#8217;s latest display had brought to mind their travails from 2016-17, Guardiola replied: &#8220;Yep.&#8220;We created three, four chances before the goal. They play man-to-man, six, eight players there, closing (down).&#8220;(Ashley) Williams, (Phil) Jagielka, (Michael) Keane, (Leighton) Baines, all the guys, they are very good in one-against-one.&#8220;We tried to find the way to attack them and we did it. (When the opposition) arrive once (in the box), score a goal, that can happen.&#8220;Our amount of opportunities on target or close to the target was good. We were there all the time. We never gave up, with the spirit of the Mancunians.&#8221;He added: &#8220;What we can do is try and create the chances. Maybe one day we&#8217;ll change, we&#8217;ll find it.&#8220;Last season we were the first or second team for creating clear chances. I think the first one. We just made (scored) 16 percent.&#8220;In that level, it&#8217;s results. In our box, it was perfect. They arrived once. But OK, we will improve.&#8221;For the second time this season, Guardiola started with Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus up front, but he withdrew Jesus at half-time as part of the reshuffle that followed Walker&#8217;s home-debut dismissal.Booked for sliding in on Leighton Baines, Walker was shown a second yellow card by referee Robert Madley two minutes later following a fairly innocuous collision with Dominic Calvert-Lewin.Guardiola refused to talk about Madley in his post-match press conference.Everton manager Ronald Koeman also had reason to rue one of the referee&#8217;s decisions after he, too, lost a player to a harsh second booking, with Morgan Schneiderlin sent off late on after sliding in to tackle Aguero.While Koeman acknowledged that Madley had a &#8220;difficult job&#8221;, he suggested Schneiderlin&#8217;s dismissal had been on the cards from the moment Walker trudged off.&#8220;I was in a good position and in my opinion he (Schneiderlin) played the ball,&#8221; said Koeman, who gave a debut to record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson.&#8220;But away against City, he&#8217;s sending off one player of City and a difficult situation, you know what the referee will do then. A yellow and his second and it&#8217;s red. You can expect it.&#8221;Koeman said he had been &#8220;disappointed&#8221; to see Sterling equalise, but said it was a &#8220;good point&#8221; to take back to Merseyside.Rooney&#8217;s goal, a first-time finish from Calvert-Lewin&#8217;s square pass, was his 200th in the Premier League.The former Manchester United striker celebrated by cupping his ears in front of City&#8217;s fans, many of whom spent the entirety of the match goading him.&#8220;He is still that player that every manager needs in his team and maybe more for Everton. He is back home,&#8221; said Koeman, who brought Rooney back to Goodison Park from United in July.&#8220;We have young players. We had three players of 20 years on the pitch against City and they did a great job. He is that experienced player, that teacher of young players. We&#8217;d like to win titles and he knows how you win titles.&#8220;It&#8217;s a big step up for the young players. Against Stoke I was really pleased about his performance.&#8220;Also tonight, with that cleverness to know exactly in every moment what is the best decision. I&#8217;m very happy about him.&#8221; Agence France-Presse
