Transport minister Joe Maswanganyi on Tuesday refuted a media report that government has proposed new laws &#8220;following the dismal failure of e-tolling revenue collection from Gauteng motorists who owe more that R6bn in unpaid tolls&#8221;.Maswanganyi was responding to a front page article published by The Star newspaper on Monday, August 28.&#8220;The article is disingenuous and misleads the public about government s position on the tolling policy, the Sanral Act and the National Land Transport Act,&#8221; he said in a statement.He said his department understands that the proposed amendment is by the Democratic Alliance and will be raised as a private member&#8217;s bill in Parliament.&#8220;Presenting the bill as an initiative of the Department of Transport, the executive and Sanral is both mischievous and misleading,&#8221; he said.Maswanganyi said he had indicated during his department&#8217;s 2017/2018 budget vote that Sanral is in the process of developing a long term strategy, Horizon 2030, aligned with the National Development Plan (NDP).&#8220;The strategy will enable the development of a 2030 Roads Plan and will review Sanral&#8217;s operating model. Also, the new strategy will trigger the development of a new toll roads policy which the Department of Transport will lead,&#8221; he said.&#8216;A failed e-Natis system&#8217; He also accused Outa chair Wayne Duvenage of being &#8220;economic with the truth when he insinuates that the e-Natis has failed&#8221;.Duvenage had reportedly said the amendments would protect motorists.&#8220;It will be better if the consultations are done by the National Council of Provinces [NCOP] and provinces which are affected. This will mean the public is consulted meaningfully, unlike in the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project - which is why it failed.&#8220;We have a failed e-Natis system and we have problems with the administration of traffic fines, and so we believe the context of the environment is one which e-tolling will fail in South Africa,&#8221; he was quoted as saying.Maswanganyi said Duvenage knows that government has been in control of e-Natis following the Constitutional Court ruling in favour of the department.&#8220;The department has since taken the decision that the Road Traffic Management Corporation [RTMC] is the preferred entity to take over the running of the system from Tasima.&#8220;The Court pronouncement on November 9, 2016 granted the Department of Transport and the RTMC leave to terminate the illegal and irregular extension of the Tasima contract,&#8221; he said.On April 7 this year, the Gauteng High Court confirmed the ruling of the Constitutional Court in favour of the Department of Transport, according to Maswanganyi.
