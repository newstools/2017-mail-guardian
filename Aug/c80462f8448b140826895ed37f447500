Out-of-favour Chelsea striker Diego Costa has launched an angry broadside against both the club and manager Antonio Conte, accusing them of treating him like a &#8220;criminal&#8221;.Costa, 28, has been informed by Conte that he has no future at the club and having been frozen out of the first-team squad, the Brazil-born Spain international has gone home to Brazil.He says Chelsea &#8220;want to sell me to China&#8221;, but has reiterated his desire to return to former club Atletico Madrid, who are under a transfer ban until January.&#8220;I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn&#8217;t want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go,&#8221; Costa said in an interview published in Monday&#8217;s Daily Mail.&#8220;In January, things happened with the coach. I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.&#8220;They gave me a week extra off, but since then it&#8217;s fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that. I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here.&#8220;So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me.&#8221;Costa was particularly scathing in his criticism of Conte, who led Chelsea to the Premier League title in his first season at Stamford Bridge.&#8220;I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that. But as a person &mdash; no,&#8221; said Costa, who was speaking in his hometown of Lagarto in northeastern Brazil.&#8220;He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn&#8217;t possess charisma.&#8221;Faced with Atletico&#8217;s inability to recruit players, Costa said he would rather spend a year not playing than join another club.&#8220;My desire is to go to Atletico,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have rejected other offers. They want to sell me to China or other teams. If I&#8217;m off, I&#8217;m going to the club I want to go to, not the club that&#8217;s paying the most.&#8220;I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don&#8217;t pay me. I&#8217;ll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I&#8217;d go back now and do as they say.&#8221;Chelsea opened their title defence in disastrous fashion on Saturday, losing 3-2 at home to Burnley, with Costa&#8217;s replacement Alvaro Morata coming off the bench to score.&copy; Agence France-Presse
