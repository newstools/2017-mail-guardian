The SABC has&nbsp;lost its bid to appeal a Western Cape High Court decision,&nbsp;which found that Hlaudi Motsoeneng s appointment as group executive of corporate affairs was unlawful.On Tuesday,&nbsp;Judge Owen Rogers said in his judgment that Motsoeneng should not be allowed to hold any position at the public broadcaster.In a case brought by the Democratic Alliance, the high&nbsp;court ruled in December that&nbsp;Motsoeneng must be removed from his position at the SABC.Rogers said that&nbsp;Motsoeneng cannot be re-appointed unless the public protector s report on the SABC is set aside and that no other court could reasonably rule that he should be re-instated. We do not think there is any reasonable prospect of another court reaching different conclusions on the issues raised in the application for leave to appeal, Rogers said.
