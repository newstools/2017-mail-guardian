Former Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe was sworn in as an ANC MP on Thursday morning, sources say. News24 and the SABC&nbsp;have reported that sources inside Parliament have reliably said that Molefe was officially sworn in in the office of the deputy&nbsp;speaker.BREAKING: Brian Molefe confirms to @eNCA tht he was sworn in as an MP this morning. He said it was all &#8220;as normal as can be&#8221;&mdash; Annika Larsen (@AnnikaLarsen1) February 23, 2017 Both Parliament and the ANC caucus spokespeople have been unable to confirm that Molefe is now an MP. SABC says that it is only the speaker who can announce that Molefe has been sworn in and&nbsp;she is expected to do so in the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; The Democratic Alliance reacted to the news Molefe has been sworn in, with David Maynier, the party s shadow minister for finance, calling the move a massive escalation in the civil war within the ruling party . The Guptas will be delighted because, if the State of Capture report is anything to go by, and Brian Molefe is eventually appointed to a position in the &#8216;finance family&#8217;, they will finally have National Treasury, the Public Investment Corporation and South African Airways on &#8216;speed dial&#8217;, Maynier said. Molefe s deployment to Parliament has been marred in controversy.&nbsp;His membership in the ANC North West branch in Hartebeespoort remains unclear as branch leaders have given contradictory statements on whether Molefe is a member or not. Furthermore, an ANC branch in Irene&nbsp;has claimed that Molefe is a member of their branch, creating further confusion. Molefe has not yet clarified the matter. Speculation remains rife that Molefe has been sworn in as an MP to&nbsp;replace finance minister Pravin Gordhan who is rumored to be axed.&nbsp;The bid is reportedly part of President Jacob Zuma s alleged increasing desire to control the Treasury. Molefe resigned from Eskom following the release of the public protector s State of Capture report, where it was alleged he had a close relationship with the Gupta family. In a press conference following the ordeal,&nbsp;a tearful Molefe said that the public protector was mistaken in saying he had made frequent visits to the Gupta compound in Saxonwold.
