Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admitted his side had &#8220;collapsed mentally&#8221; in their 5-1 Champions League rout by Bayern Munich on Wednesday.The under-pressure Frenchman said there were no excuses as the Gunners faced a seventh successive last-16 exit after their latest mauling.&#8220;We conceded the second goal and then the most important thing was that we lost Laurent Koscielny (to injury). We collapsed mentally,&#8221; said Wenger who will now face fresh calls for his resignation.Wenger&#8217;s post-match press conference lasted barely five minutes and was cut short after he answered just a few questions.&#8220;I am not looking for excuses. Overall I must say they were a better team than us, they played very well in the second half and we dropped our level,&#8221; he added.&#8220;They were better than us, well done to Bayern. Their third goal was a killer&#8212;we had no response.&#8221; It is a shock of course to lose at this level.&#8221;Wenger refused to discuss his personal mood after the match.&#8220;How I feel I don&#8217;t think is the most important but of course it is disappointing,&#8221; he said although pundits thought otherwise.&#8220;He looked particularly wounded. I feel for him&#8212;he almost needs to be protected from himself,&#8221; former Arsenal defender Martin Keown told BT Sport.&#8220;This is a massive low point for him. This brings forward the change that looks likely at the end of the season.&#8221;Arjen Robben opened the scoring after just 11 minutes at the Allianz Arena when the Dutchman beat Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina with a fine left-foot strike into the top corner.Chile international Alexis Sanchez levelled for Arsenal on the half-hour, hitting in a rebound at the second attempt after he had a controversial penalty saved by Manuel Neuer.But Robert Lewandowski restored the German side&#8217;s lead after 53 minutes, heading in a cross from Philipp Lahm with Thiago Alcantara adding a third just three minutes later.Thiago piled on the misery for Arsene Wenger&#8217;s men with his second and Bayern&#8217;s fourth just after the hour with substitute Thomas Mueller adding a fifth two minutes from time.Wenger said the loss of Koscielny just after the break&#8212;with the scores at 1-1&#8212;turned the game.&#8220;It was a strange game because we played quite well in the first half, we then conceded goals in quick succession,&#8221; said Wenger.&#8220;I d have loved to have kept Laurent on the pitch and it s difficult to measure the impact, but the fact is we have to cope with the result. We had an extremely bad result tonight.&#8220;It was difficult to shake off the two goals in quick succession&#8212;we lost our organisation and our centre back.&#8221;The Frenchman said his side lost their composure after Lewandowski&#8217;s powerful header from a cross and suffered a &#8220;nightmare&#8221; final 25 minutes.&#8220;We were badly done for the second goal and the real problems came after the third goal, because we lost our organisation,&#8221; he added.&#8220;We were very jaded and vulnerable from that moment on. The last 25 minutes were a nightmare for us, because we had no response.&#8221; Agence France-Presse
