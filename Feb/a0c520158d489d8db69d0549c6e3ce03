Furthermore, as per this policy, Taiwan is considered a part of China.China is currently South Africa s biggest trading partner.Previously, Msimanga s office dismissed criticism of the trip as &#8220;short-sighted&#8221;.&#8220;The Executive Mayor of Tshwane believes that all potential opportunities for trade and investment must be diligently interrogated,&#8221; said spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi late last month.On Monday, Kodwa said that Msimanga, as a senior government official, was &#8220;bound&#8221; by existing government policy.Besides the suggestion of taking away the official passports of those who contravene the policy, the ANC also suggested that the Taipei Liason Office in Tshwane be reprimanded for issuing the invitation to Msimanga, as an act of &#8220;extreme disrespect for our foreign policy&#8221;.Government departments and parastatals also needed to be &#8220;remind[ed]&#8221; of the country s foreign policy, as well as &#8220;the centrality of the Presidency and Dirco&#8221;, suggested Kodwa.&#8220;The City government of Tshwane is not an autonomous state which acts on a frolic of its own outside of government policy.&#8221;He said that Msimanga had transgressed, not only government policy but also &#8220;the spirit of co-operative governance as enshrined in the constitution&#8221;.&#8220;He has started a precedence which, if allowed, can only render the entire system of government impotent,&#8221; warned Kodwa. -&nbsp; News24
