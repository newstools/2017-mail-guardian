Planned protests outside the Parliament where president Jacob Zuma is delivering the State of the Nation address failed to gain traction as more than a thousand people flocked to the Grand Parade where the ANC is holding its first ever people s assembly.About 200 members and supporters of the Economic Freedom Fighters gathered on Adderley Street leading to the Parliament with placards calling for Zuma to step down. Civil society groups who planned to stage their own protests also failed to gain support and the demonstration never materialised.About 150 pupils from the Sinethemba High School in Phillipi confronted police dressed in full riot gear were marshaled down the side streets after they tried to march towards the Parliament precinct.The scuffle ended with the group retreating to the Grand Parade. Among them was Samkelisiwe Jacqa, a grade 10 pupil whose maroon school blazer and tie is neatly tucked into his backpack. Jacqa took off his school uniform to put on a T-shirt bearing the ANC president s face, with the words Zuma The Liberator printed on it. I came here to support president Zuma and the ANC. They fetched us after school with about six busses to come here, Jacqa said.School pupils and the elderly make up the majority of people at the ANC event, which is scheduled to run parallel to the State of the Nation address, and will be attended by Zuma after his speech. The event has showcased performances by cultural and gospel artists while pictures from the red carpet are shown on big screens.Western Cape ANC spokesperson Yonela Diko said the party expects 400 busses to bring people to the event. All of them are from the region. Not even the entire Western Cape, only Cape Town, Diko said.He attempted to demonstrate the support the party has in the city, which was&nbsp;won by the Democratic Alliance with a two thirds majority in the local government election.Many of the people attending the event said they were from the Khayelitsha, Gugulethu and Philippi townships.
