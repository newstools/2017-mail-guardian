Speaking to the media for the first time since the Economic Freedom Fighters&#8217;&nbsp;forceful removal from Parliament during the State of the Nation address on Thursday, Julius Malema compared former acting president Kgalema Motlanthe to ANC stalwart Oliver Tambo.Malema, referring to himself as a political analyst, offered several pointers on how the ANC can resuscitate itself. He pointed out that&nbsp;Motlanthe&nbsp;is the only person who can carry the ANC because &#8220;he is like Oliver Tambo&#8221;.The ANC has dubbed 2017 the year of Oliver Tambo.&nbsp;&#8220;If I had to choose I would choose Kgalema,&#8221; said Malema. &#8220;He is the only person that can take ANC out of this crisis.&#8221;#Malema: if I could choose I&#8217;d choose Kgalema. Kgalema is closest to O.R Tambo. Kgalema can start a process of rebuilding ANC. #EFFPresser&mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 14, 2017 #Malema: it doesn&#8217;t really matter who becomes President of ANC.
