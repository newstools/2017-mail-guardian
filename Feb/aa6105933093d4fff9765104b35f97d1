Andrew Tshabangu, Footprints at the Standard Bank Gallery, corner of Simmonds and Frederick Streets, Johannesburg. Contemporary photographer Andrew Tshabangu s exhibition Footprints opens on Friday February 17 and runs until April 29. The exhibition documents a selected body of Tshabangu s photography, spanning 25 years. It covers the exceptional and the mundane about Johannesburg in what the exhibition s curator, Thembinkosi Goniwe, calls the bearable lightness of being black in the world . The series of black-and-white photographs captures an indefinable aesthetic of private life in post-apartheid South Africa.Tune Recreation Committee plays at The Orbit (Johannesburg) and The Chairman (Durban). The Cape Town-based band, better known as TRC, features Clement Benny on drums, Nicholas Williams on bass, Keenan Chas Ahrends on guitar, Mandla Mlangeni on trumpet and special guest Mark Fransman on alto saxophone, flute and accordion. TRC perform at The Orbit tonight and at The Chairman on Saturday night. The unit has been defined as a playground for the interrogation, assimilation and extended extemporisation from the canon of South African jazz heritage . In other words, these musos take original tunes and reinvent them by incorporating styles ranging from drum n bass to Balkanology and ghoema. Both shows are priced at R150.
