I was still buzzing from my earlier encounter. Who would have thought that I would get to meet Dr Precious Moloi–Motsepe herself.
I was awestruck, inspired — her level of drive and motivation is contagious. Successful people have a way of rubbing their essence off on you just by being in your presence. What a start to Fashion Week. Fast forward a few hours and I was mingling with friends and strangers in the luxury Sandton venue. But this was not a time to party, it was a moment to appreciate the works of art worn by the models. The results of hours of blood, sweat and tears, which most undermine and take lightly in terms of the amount of work put into this industry. Then I saw them: the clothes that would change my life. The designs were breathtaking. As LaQuan Smith creations were paraded on the runway the entire room seemed to disappear. It was just me and those intricate yet simple constructions, those fascinating outfits. The unblemished arrangements spelt it out for me. I had to follow my dream. Working as a property agent brought in a stable, decent income. It even enabled me to help out a little at home. Plus I actually kind of liked being in the property management and sales sector.  But it didn’t inspire me. And that designer did.  Dropping the agent gig would be risky, but I realised in that moment that life is not about playing it safe. If it were, no one would have had the guts to make those clothes that inspired me so much.  This is my chance to make something of my life. I decided then and there that I would head back to school to follow my dream of studying fashion. And not just that: I figured there’s nothing stopping me from doing my own art through my vision, in my own capacity. So that’s what I did. Looking back now, successfully balancing a freelance design career and varsity, I think I know the key to life — allowing inspiration and passion to drive you.  — Kari Sekati, as told to Luke Feltham
