A quest to&nbsp;have President Jacob Zuma removed from office has created a united movement of opposition parties which say they will put their differences aside today to march against the president. Thousands of representatives from the EFF, DA, Cope, ACDP, AIC and IFP have arrived at the Union Buildings in Pretoria where they will make their unified call for Zuma to resign. &#8220;We are going to march hand in hand. We are sending one message and one message only. Zuma must step down!&#8221; EFF leader Julius Malema said. &#8220;EFF members allow other parties to be among you. As we march we want to see other party colours here. Hold hands together.&#8221;Mood right now at the #NationalDayofAction pic.twitter.com/XdPch9Fg1k&mdash; raeesa pather (@raediology) April 12, 2017 Demonstrators gathered at Church Square in the Pretoria CBD this morning and began the march amid a heavy police presence. Although today isn&#8217;t a holiday, many businesses in the CBD have been closed in anticipation of the large crowds that will make their way through the city throughout the day. Political party leaders such as Malema, Cope s Mosiuoa Lekota and the DA&#8217;s Phumzile Van Damme will deliver their addresses to the many calling for Zuma&#8217;s resignation.
