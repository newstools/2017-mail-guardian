We were hoping, today, for example, to raise R600-million in the bond market on a short-term basis &mdash; and bids for just over R200-million were actually offered, because there s this concern about the economy rising from the announcements made yesterday, Gordhan said on Friday.S&amp;P on Monday&nbsp;placed South Africa&#8217;s credit rating&nbsp;to speculative grade (commonly referred to as &#8220;junk&#8221;), a one-notch reduction to BB, and the ratings agency said &#8220;the economic crises President Jacob Zuma plunged the country into with his midnight cabinet reshuffle&#8221; prompted it to hold an emergency review at the weekend instead of June 2, as was scheduled, according to Business Day.Moody&#8217;s scheduled review of South Africa is on Friday (April 7) and it remains unclear when Fitch, which has a near-junk status rating for the country at BBB-, will release its review.
