Democratic Alliance members and supporters have gathered at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown, Johannesburg to demand that President Jacob Zuma be removed. Around 1 500 people dressed in blue were accompanied by private security as they marched to Newtown. The private security guards came from Eyethu Events. Around 100 of the guards continued to form a human chain around the DA truck that blared music and speeches. At the back of the truck the words &#8220;Fire Zuma&#8221; were written akin to a number plate. DA leader Mmusi Maimane stood among a crowd of DA supporters during the march. He continued to demand: &#8220;phantsi Jacob Zuma phantsi!&#8221; and &#8220;voetsek corruption, voetsek!&#8221;.Lize Roodt and Piroska Warren are marching with DA. Here&#8217;s why they want Zuma to go: #AntiZumaMarch #MarchforChange pic.twitter.com/mhcXgi0jEP&mdash; raeesa pather (@raediology) April 7, 2017 Walter Dono (40) a DA branch chairperson in Vereeniging told the Mail &amp; Guardian that Zuma is not fit to lead. &#8220;We don&#8217;t dispute the fact that the ANC is the leading party and the majority of the people voted for them. We&#8217;re saying the delegate that they put as president is not fit to lead our country,&#8221; Dono said. Fedusa general secretary Dennis George called on protesters not to be intimidated by members of the Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association in the area. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be intimidated by these people who wear camouflage. They must go back to the bush.&#8221;&nbsp; Religious members from the Muslim, Hindu and Christian communities recited prayers as the DA proceedings got under way.
