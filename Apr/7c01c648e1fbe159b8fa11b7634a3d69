THE PLAY LIST Black Christ of the Andes: Mary-Lou Williams. Like this unforgettable utterance from the one and only Sweet Brown &mdash; Oh Lord Jesus, it s a fire &mdash; the churchy chronicles on jazz/soul singer and pianist Mary Lou Williams s 1964 album, Black Christ of the Andes, call up the revivalist voices of male gospel singers &mdash; voices that are akin to a hot-bottomed heel at the end of a fiery sermon in the American South. &mdash; MBDAMN: Kendrick Lamar. Give us the raps and the beats. Keep the histrionics. I recently watched Lamar s performance at Coachella, an annual music and arts festival in Indio, California. It was great to see a rapper use a band but feel cocky enough to rhyme on a huge cavernous stage on his own. Sometimes rappers play hide-and-seek when there s a band around. As for his latest album, DAMN, released last week, my picks are DNA, LOYALTY, FEEL, HUMBLE,&nbsp;DUCKWORTH and ELEMENT. &mdash; KSCarandiru:S o Paulo s Carandiru prison was demolished in 2002. Carandiru the movie was released in 2003, making it the last thing the notorious penitentiary in Brazil was used for. A fitting tribute to all the souls incarcerated there, the film serves as a portrait of humanity thriving and struggling under inhumane conditions. I last saw it about eight years ago, but it remains etched in my memory. &mdash; KSTHE READING LIST Falling Upwards: Richard Rohr. In an interview last week with&nbsp;journalist and author Krista Tippett, Franciscan priest Father Richard Rohr said: Few people&nbsp;can go through a spiritual transformation alone. You have to get out of the way so that something else can guide you. He went on&nbsp;to say: Human sexuality is as&nbsp;mysterious as God. Having heard these gems, I searched on my&nbsp;Kindle and immediately downloaded this book about spiritual practice for the first and second halves of one s life. &mdash; MBThe Lists are compiled by Friday editor Milisuthando Bongela and arts writer Kwanele Sosibo
