Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund are among the top scorers in the Champions&nbsp;League this season and will need their sharp-shooters at their deadliest to stay in the hunt for Europe&#8217;s biggest prize.Both sides are aiming to pull off unlikely comebacks in quarter-final second legs on Wednesday on what promises to be another night of high drama.Holders Real Madrid and last year&#8217;s beaten finalists&#8212;and city rivals&#8212;Atletico are already in the hat for Friday&#8217;s semi-final draw.Led by Lionel Messi and Neymar, Barca made history in the previous round, becoming the first side to overturn a four-goal first-leg deficit to progress.And how: three goals in the closing minutes at the Camp Nou propelled them to a stunning 6-1 thrashing of Paris Saint-Germain and a quarter-final berth.But any hopes they had learnt their lesson disappeared in last week&#8217;s first leg in Turin where Juventus ran out deserved 3-0 winners and Messi was largely anonymous.It might seem a tall order to pull off another stirring comeback&#8212;even for Barcelona&#8212;but the Spanish champions have scored a minimum of four goals in every home match in this season&#8217;s competition and they haven&#8217;t been playing Champions League novices.Manchester City and Borussia Moenchengladbach shipped four each, PSG leaked six and Celtic&#8217;s goal was breached seven times.Barca coach Luis Enrique maintains belief in his &#8220;group of winners and champions capable of anything&#8221;.&#8220;In the previous tie we were able to overcome an even more difficult result,&#8221; he said.But Juve might be a different proposition altogether, having conceded only two goals in eight games in Europe.And if anyone knows how to defend a lead away from home, it&#8217;s an Italian team.Modest Malaga have cracked the code to stopping Barca&#8217;s much-vaunted attacking triumvirate of Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar.This month they beat Barcelona 2-0 having held them to a 0-0 draw at the Camp Nou in November&#8212;Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri will surely have studied those matches.Dortmund meanwhile trail only by a single goal to Monaco but they will have to launch a comeback away from home and with the trauma of last week&#8217;s attack on their team bus still fresh in the memory.A subdued Dortmund lost 3-2 at home to the French Ligue 1 leaders&#8212;clearly affected by the triple bomb blast the day before that forced a 24-hour postponement of the game and left Spanish defender Marc Bartra in hospital with a broken wrist.The task facing Borussia is perhaps more about managing their emotions than simply trying to overcome free-scoring opponents who were the second side in Europe to reach 100 goals in all competitions this season&#8212;beaten only by Barca by a few minutes.Following Saturday&#8217;s 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel praised his side&#8217;s &#8220;incredible character&#8221; but admitted his players are still &#8220;learning to deal with the fluctuating emotions&#8221;.
