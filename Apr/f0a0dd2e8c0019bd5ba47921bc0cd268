Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba knew that Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s (S&amp;P) rating agency would downgrade South Africa to junk status on Friday March 31, just hours after he was made minister of finance.At a press briefing on Tuesday April 4, Gigaba said he did not know when S&amp;P had decided on the economic downgrade. On Friday morning, just after President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s midnight announcement that finance minister Pravin Gordhan had been axed, Gigaga was informed that S&amp;P had downgraded South Africa&#8217;s credit rating to junk status.&#8220;When I walked into office on Friday the decision had been made,&#8221; Gigaba said.S&amp;P may have made its decision on South Africa&#8217;s credit rating late on Thursday or early on Friday morning. Gigaba met Moody&#8217;s and Fitch rating agencies on Friday, but decided not to meet S&amp;P after it became clear that they would not change their decision.&#8220;It was not necessary to talk to them, [because] it would not change the decision,&#8221; he said.Gigaba said that he did not tell South Africans of the downgrade at a press briefing he held on Saturday, because he did not want to lose the trust of S&amp;P, who he said had made known the credit downgrade in confidence.In the coming days, the minister and his team will finalise plans to begin talking with S&amp;P about the downgrade. The press briefing was delayed by more than two hours because Gigaba held a handover&nbsp;meeting&nbsp;with&nbsp;Gordhan. He said the former finance minister&nbsp;had also assisted in discussing the downgrade.The two will continue to meet in the coming days. &#8220;Our discussions covered a whole range of issues but were not concluded,&#8221; Gigaba said.&#8220;We did not abandon radical economic transformation&#8221; Moody&#8217;s has said that it will not issue a credit rating this week as it had planned. The rating agency had put South Africa on review for a downgrade after the Cabinet reshuffle last week.Gigaba said the meetings with Moody&#8217;s and Fitch would address issues of political stability and policy to &#8220;reassure&#8221; them that &#8220;there&#8217;s not been a change in government&#8221;.The minister emphasised that even though the position of finance minister and deputy minister had changed, government policies still remain the same.&nbsp;&#8220;We did not abandon radical economic transformation,&#8221; Gigaba said. And&nbsp;inclusive growth remained a priority in boosting the economy.&nbsp;&#8220;We acknowledge that yesterday&#8217;s announcement [of the S&amp;P downgrade] was a setback. Despite our challenges, now is not the time for despondency,&#8221; he said.Moody&#8217;s has&nbsp;indicated that South Africa is at risk of a credit downgrade to junk status because of the change in leaders in key institutions such as the&nbsp;treasury.Three officials in the ANC top six - ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC treasury general&nbsp;Zweli Mkhize&nbsp;- have spoken out against the Cabinet reshuffle. Ramaphosa called it &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;.Gigaba says he has written to the ANC, to be sent once he has signed it, because he is &#8220;concerned that discordant views are creating confusion&#8221; and a divided&nbsp;ANC will &#8220;continue to harm us&#8221;.&nbsp;He plans to meet the ANC to &#8220;discuss the importance of political management&#8221;.&nbsp;
