United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa has pleaded with the leaders of&nbsp;political parties and civil society organisations to move beyond marching for the removal of&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma.Following Zuma s decision to reshuffle his Cabinet, a series of countrywide marches calling for the president s head ensued.Holomisa, who was at the forefront of the national day of action march on April 12 against the president,&nbsp;is the orchestrator behind the UDM&#8217;s Constitutional Court secret ballot application.&nbsp;He has now released a statement asking South Africans to look for ways to remove the president besides protest marches. When South Africans marched under the leadership of the opposition parties at the national day of action, 12 April 2017, I advised that we cannot march forever, but that we must find a way to converge under one roof to discuss South Africa s future, said Holomisa.The UDM proposes that leaders of political parties and civil society organisations&nbsp;first meet to thresh out the issues to be tabled at a future national summit We may therefore soon need to have a national summit, which should ultimately culminate in a national convention, where&nbsp;leaders of political parties and civil society can exchange ideas on how to take South Africa forward. We should find solutions to our current set of challenges and, most importantly, set the ball rolling so that we may leave behind a prosperous country for future generations. &nbsp;The national summit,&nbsp;according to Holomisa, will allow for the establishment of minimum binding principles &hellip; to tease out the details of the programme to be implemented .
