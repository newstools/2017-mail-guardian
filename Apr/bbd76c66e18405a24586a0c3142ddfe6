Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has said that it would be &#8220;unlawful&#8221; if National Assembly&nbsp;Speaker&nbsp;Baleka Mbete did&nbsp;not make a decision on the use of a secret ballot during the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.In an affidavit filed at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, Malema pledged the EFF&#8217;s support of the United Democratic Movement&#8217;s (UDM) application for the court to compel Mbete to make a decision on a secret ballot for the motion of no confidence vote.Malema argued in court papers that Mbete and former president Kgalema&nbsp;Motlanthe&nbsp;had been elected to their positions in Parliament by secret ballot. In both instances, the Democratic Alliance&nbsp;had nominated other opponents to the ANC candidates, which&nbsp;resulted&nbsp;in a secret ballot being held.The ANC still secured the majority vote on both occasions.&#8220;It is a clear that the mere fact that an election is by a secret vote per se does not inhibit a party from canvassing its position of its members who are also members of Parliament,&#8221; Malema said in court papers.He argued&nbsp;that the rules of Parliament &#8220;specifically clothe&#8221; Mbete, as the speaker, with discretion in the National Assembly. The EFF leader said the court should &#8220;direct&#8221; Mbete to &#8220;discharge her obligation&#8221; so that the national executive is held to account.&#8220;It is accordingly simply unlawful for the speaker to refuse to exercise her discretion in the matter,&#8221; Malema said.Mbete has previously said that she does not have the power to apply a secret ballot in Parliament, but constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos has written that the speaker does have discretion, according to National Assembly rule 103 and 104.&#8220;The speaker has claimed that she does not have a discretion to order a secret ballot. This claim is either deliberately misleading or the result of a lack of intellectual inquisitiveness on the part of the speaker,&#8221;&nbsp;De Vos wrote. The Inkatha Freedom Party has also filed papers supporting the UDM&#8217;s bid.&nbsp;
