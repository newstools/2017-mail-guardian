The president said that an &#8220;intelligence report&#8221; revealed that&nbsp;Gordhan and Fuzile were organising an investment strike meant to weaken his government.&nbsp;There are now concerns that Fuzile&#8217;s resignation could lead to an&nbsp;&#8220;exodus of technocrats in one of South Africa s best-run government departments in the wake of&#8221; the reshuffle.&nbsp;South Africa&#8217;s credit rating was yesterday&nbsp;downgraded to junk for the first time in 17 years. Standard&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Poor&#8217;s&nbsp;cited the Cabinet reshuffle as the main&nbsp;reason behind the downgrade.&nbsp;Fuzile said on Monday that&nbsp; People should be allowed to leave. I don t want to be permanent in my role, a hint that he was considering leaving the Treasury.
