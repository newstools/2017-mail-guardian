While the spat between former Hawks head Lieutenant&nbsp;General Berning Ntlemeza and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula escalates, Hawks officials have focussed on stabilising the office and giving support to new acting boss Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata.On Monday, Mbalula held a press briefing outside the Hawks&#8217;s offices in Pretoria, where he accused Ntlemeza of using a state-owned vehicle without authorisation. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed that Ntlemeza had returned the car during Mbalula&#8217;s press briefing, but could not say if the former Hawks boss had been authorised to use the vehicle.READ MORE:&nbsp; Ntlemeza will be arrested if he doesn&#8217;t bring car back immediatelyNtlemeza&#8217;s legal team has now finalised court papers to force Mbalula to retract his instruction that the former Hawks boss cannot return to work. Mbalula gave the order after a ruling by the high court in Pretoria&nbsp;set aside his appointment as Hawks head.Despite the public squabble unfurling between the minister and Ntlemeza,&nbsp;Mulaudzi said&nbsp;all is normal inside Hawks headquarters.&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s business as usual, everyone is working.&#8221;He told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the verbal scuffle between Mbalula and Ntlemeza is separate from the Hawks. The priority inside the Hawks&#8217; building is to restore enough stability and help Matakata in her new position.&#8220;We have said that this is not an issue between us and General Ntlemeza. It&#8217;s been Minister Mbalula and General Ntlemeza.&#8221;&nbsp;The Hawks have had a troubled few years. In 2015, former boss Shadrack Sibiya was suspended by Ntlemeza following allegations that he had been involved in the illegal rendition of Zimbabweans in 2010. The high court ruled that the suspension was unconstitutional, and said the&nbsp;acting Hawks boss is dishonest and lacks integrity.Ntlemeza has now sought leave to appeal the latest high court ruling that his appointment be set aside. His lawyer, Comfort Ngidi, is relying on a section of the Superior Courts Act, which states that as soon as an appeal is filed, the decision of the high court is automatically suspended.Mbalula cannot legally remove Ntlemeza from his post; only Parliament has the power to do that.Ntlemeza returned to work on Monday. His role at the Hawks will be determined by Matakata&#8217;s instruction.&nbsp;
