The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) will convene a special central committee meeting to deal with the events that led to it cancelling all the speeches at its main May Day rally.Cosatu said in a statement on Wednesday that it regretted that Monday&#8217;s main May Day rally in Bloemfontein, where President Jacob Zuma was booed by a portion of the crowd, was turned into &#8220;political theatre&#8221;.&#8220;Of course, without a doubt, this was a regrettable and unacceptable incident and we shall be convening an urgent special central committee meeting to deal with what happened and also decide on a way forward in preparation for the upcoming central committee meeting.&#8220;We do regret that workers did not hear the federation&#8217;s message from the Cosatu president and that their event was hijacked and converted into a political theatre.&#8221;The union blasted those who said all its rallies had been cancelled, saying the vast majority of them had been successful.&#8220;In Bloemfontein, the only part of the celebration that was cancelled was the last part, where the main May Day message and the accompanying solidarity messages were to be delivered.&#8220;It is therefore not true and quite misleading for anyone to say that the national May Day event was completely cancelled in Bloemfontein.&#8221;Workers &#8216;angry&#8217; at ANC factionalism Cosatu said some of the disruptions at May Day rallies on Monday reflect workers&#8217; anger toward an increasingly factionalised ANC.The deteriorating relationship between the ANC and its&nbsp;alliance partners and the factionalised nature of alliance politics of late were evident at Cosatu&#8217;s main rally in Bloemfontein this week.&#8220;It also reflects the fact that workers have reached a dead end and are angry with the factionalised state of the ANC and the dearth of leadership in the movement,&#8221; Cosatu said.Cosatu said it was concerning that some leaders of factions within the ANC organised events to coincide with their May Day celebrations.&#8220;There were also some crowds that were rented with the purpose to disrupt the national event in Bloemfontein.&#8220;We condemn these reactionary acts of hooliganism and we shall raise this issue sharply when we meet with our alliance partners in the soon-to-be-convened alliance political council meeting.&#8221;Cosatu said it regrets that the alliance has reached a stage where organisational power is not used for asserting a people-centred development, but rather used to fight internal factional battles to get people elected.&#8216;Double standards&#8217; They also slammed those who said the events were a result of the union publicly backing Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Zuma at the ANC&#8217;s elective conference in December.&#8220;It is noticeable that the same ANC lacks the appetite to reprimand its own structures that are openly campaigning in support of Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.&#8220;It is these double standards and factionalised reasoning that are testing the patience of the workers and ultimately eroding the discipline and the comradeship that has united the alliance for decades.&#8221;Workers were growing tired of the ANC government&#8217;s failure to deal honestly and decisively with issues like e-tolls, labour brokers, unemployment and retrenchments, the labour union federation argued.Cosatu warned the ANC that workers no longer wanted to remain &#8220;enslaved in waged labour&#8221;.It finished by saying it was an unshaken member of the alliance and would stand firm as their struggle for workers&#8217; rights was political in nature.The ANC meanwhile&nbsp;slammed Gupta-owned broadcaster ANN7 for reporting that three top party leaders had pushed Zuma to attend Cosatu&#8217;s rally. -&nbsp;News24
