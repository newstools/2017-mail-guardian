After a five-hour session of&nbsp;questions and answers, Parliament&#8217;s portfolio committee on public enterprises failed to get an explanation from Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown&nbsp;on why Brian Molefe was re-appointed&nbsp;Eskom chief executive.On Tuesday,&nbsp;Brown and Eskom chair Ben Ngubane were grilled by MPs in the committee but both did not substantially answer any of the questions put to them.&nbsp;Initially, Ngubane refused to delve into any explanation, arguing that the matter had been brought to the attention of the high court in Pretoria&nbsp;in an application by the Democratic Alliance and&nbsp;thus he could not discuss the&nbsp;issue because it is before court.But MPs dismissed his argument. The minister and Eskom chairperson faced tough questions from the ANC, DA and Economic Freedom Front MPs.&nbsp;In response to a question from ANC MP Pravin Gordhan on whether Brown had been instructed to reappoint Molefe, the minister answered &#8220;no&#8221;.She added that she did not take instructions from anyone.As minister, it is at her discretion to hire board members and chief executives at the power utility.&nbsp;Yet Brown did not clarify why she had allowed the Eskom board to reappoint Molefe.&nbsp;Molefe&#8217;s return to Eskom has been met with public disbelief. Initially, Molefe had said he had&nbsp;resigned from Eskom following allegations against him in the public protector&#8217;s State of Capture report. He later said he had taken early retirement, which entitled him to a pension payout of R30-million.&nbsp;In court papers yesterday, Molefe and Brown swore in their&nbsp;affidavit that he had never left Eskom and was simply on &#8220;unpaid leave&#8221;. This is despite Molefe&#8217;s appearance on the ANC benches in Parliament after he was sworn in as an MP.Neither Brown nor members of Eskom&#8217;s board said which version of events was true,Of Brown&#8217;s and Eskom&#8217;s responses to questions, chairperson of the committee Zukie Rantho simply said: &#8220;We are not convinced.&#8221;&nbsp;She went on to say that she believes Molefe&#8217;s reappointment is illegal and that a&nbsp;Parliamentary inquiry should be initiated.It is unclear how the inquiry will be structured and whether it will investigate the Eskom board or just Molefe&#8217;s reappointment.&nbsp;After the portfolio committee meeting was adjourned,&nbsp;members&nbsp;remained to discuss the possible inquiry.&nbsp;Among issues raised were Eskom&#8217;s links to Gupta-owned entities such as Tegeta, Trillian and Oakbay.&nbsp;ANC MP Pravin&nbsp;Gordhan accused individuals on the Eskom board of having ties to the family, but Eskom board member Pat Naidoo denied the claim.Rantho said the Gupta family could be subpoenaed to appear before Parliament.The Eskom board and Brown will appear in the high court in&nbsp;Pretoria&nbsp;on May 30,&nbsp;when the DA&#8217;s application will be heard.&nbsp;
