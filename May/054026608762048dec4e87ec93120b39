Public enterprises Minister Lynne Brown will face Parliament&#8217;s portfolio committee on public enterprises to explain why Brian Molefe was reappointed as chief executive of Eskom. The Eskom board will be there, too.The portfolio committee asked Brown to appear in Parliament after Molefe returned to Eskom last week following his leave from Eskom after damning allegations were published against him in the public protector&#8217;s State of Capture report. Molefe was accused of having close ties to the infamous Gupta family in the report.Affidavits filed by Molefe and Brown yesterday said that Molefe had never resigned from Eskom, instead he was simply on &#8220;unpaid leave&#8221;. The explanation was met with public scepticism after the post for Eskom chief executive was advertised and Molefe was appointed to Parliament as an ANC MP following his leave from Eskom.Watch the live stream below:
