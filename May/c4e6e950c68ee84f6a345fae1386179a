The Gupta family on Sunday morning responded to reports based on internal e-mails, denying all wrongdoing through their lawyer, Gert van der Merwe.But the family would not be able to respond properly until it saw the e-mail The Sunday Times and City Press said showed the family controlled certain family members.The response, in full, reads: The reports rely on undisclosed documents and assumptions of impropriety resulting in a clear intention to influence political perception which is another example of fake news. I invite the newsrooms relying on these documents to disclose them (and the sources from which it was ostensibly obtained) to my client for consideration and comment if possible. Once the documents are studied and verified my client will be in a position to comment if justified. The family deny any wrongdoing or paying any amounts to ministers or the President and reserve its rights.
