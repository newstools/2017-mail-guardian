His ability at preventing shots at goal has been the mainstay of Phumlani Ntshangase s rise and is a key reason Wits University s defensive formation is described as one of the tightest in the domestic game this year.But last week, Ntshangase revealed a different side to his repertoire, displaying the deft skills of a striker as he rattled the net for the only goal of the match that opened up a three-point lead at the summit of the Premiership. I am aware that the goal could prove crucial at the end of the season, said 22-year-old Ntshangase. But it is not about me. It is about the collective. Few people know how painful it is for us at Wits to have started well in the previous two championships only to finish third and second respectively. It is painful, disappointing, hurtful, confusing and frustrating. For me personally it has been difficult, particularly because I had to deal with injuries that forced me to sit out most of the matches at the beginning of the season. With injuries, the season started poorly for the utility defender, who is equally at home either as right fullback or left back. Coach Gavin Hunt reintroduced him to the first team gradually and with the Clever Boys now at the summit of the league, Ntshangase has proved to be one of the mainstays. Some people say coach Hunt played me in an unusual libero position against Maritzburg United. Truth is that central defence is my preferred position, but I was converted into a holding midfielder when I was promoted from the youth structures. I guess this was because I could pass the ball perfectly with either foot, said the Olympian who has slotted easily into the Wits rearguard alongside veteran Bongani Khumalo as Wits push for the championship.
