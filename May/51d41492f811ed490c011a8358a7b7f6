Stellenbosch University has made headway in investigating the imitation Nazi posters that surfaced on its campus on Tuesday. The investigation, led by its Equality Unit and Student Discipline division, has identified three individuals linked to planning the Anglo-Afrikaaner event. Stellenbosch s media liaison, Martin Viljoen, confirmed that, as it stands, the event and posters were primarily organised by one main organiser , with the support of others. We can t say at this stage that an organisation was behind this, our understanding at the moment is that it s an individual that tried to organise this meeting, said Viljoen..@StellenboschUni There&#8217;s more pic.twitter.com/9PhpaaAGRh&mdash; Jodi X (@Jodi_Will) May 9, 2017 Viljoen confirmed that the faux-Nazi posters which caused mass outrage were placed in order to advertise for an actual event and were not simply a joke. Our understanding at this stage is that they wanted to seriously hold this event. Exactly what their aim was, and what the content of the meeting was, will form part of the continued investigation, said Viljoen. &nbsp;The Daily Vox
