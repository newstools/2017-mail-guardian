We gave them some basic lessons in Marxism, which is supposed to be their ideology. Although Mngxitama said that Carrim had a mandate from white capital , he doesn t hold any hard feelings. We are not fighting black people. Even Carrim is black, he just has Indian superiority consciousness just like Gandhi. But he s our person. Ultimately, we&#8217;ll accept him back home when he s done selling out, said Mngxitama.&nbsp;
