Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini spent just over R2-million on two new luxury ministerial cars in the past financial year, a parliamentary reply has revealed.She and deputy minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu spent R1.3-million on a luxury BMW and R1.1-million on a Jeep Grand Cherokee in the 2016-17 financial year, despite new government austerity measures, Dlamini said in a reply to a question on Wednesday.She claimed the purchases were warranted, as the previous ministerial cars were bought in 2009 and they needed new cars to travel around Pretoria.&#8220;The official Pretoria-based vehicles allocated to the minister and the deputy minister in 2009 have far exceeded the prescribed 120 000km and the five-year period,&#8221; she said, citing the ministerial handbook.&#8220;As such the purchase of new official vehicles became unavoidable and needed replacement due to high maintenance costs and security reasons.&#8221;&#8216;Disgrace&#8217; Ministers and deputy ministers are allowed a maximum of two ministerial vehicles, one each for Pretoria and Cape Town.&#8220;In compliance with the national treasury&#8217;s cost-containment measures, the department has delayed the purchase of official vehicles for Cape Town,&#8221; she said.The money was approved two years ago in the 2014-15 financial year, but she did not explain why the Pretoria cars were not purchased then.Democratic Alliance MP Bridget Masango on Thursday said Dlamini&#8217;s purchase was a &#8220;disgrace&#8221; in the face of growing poverty and unemployment in SA.Dlamini on Wednesday told the social development committee that the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) needed R6-billion and at least five years to take over the social grants scheme fully. Sassa chief executive&nbsp;Thokozani Magwaza had predicted it could be done in&nbsp;two to three years.She said Sassa currently did not have the expertise to manage the grants scheme on its own and that South Africans should see the sum as a long-term investment.The current contract with outgoing service provider Cash Paymaster Services, which ends in March 2018, is currently worth a third of that, around R2-billion a year. -&nbsp;News24
