The streets of Eldorado were quiet Wednesday morning after protests over lack of housing in Eldorado Park continued into Tuesday. At least three petrol stations were looted on Tuesday. Door and windows were broken, remnants of food and empty cool drink bottles littered the ground. Residents are concerned they haven&#8217;t been able to find any shops stocking bread or any other essentials to eat. Small groups of people are gathering in the streets in search of information about what will happen next and whether the protests will continue. #EldoradoPark resident Rene Fresling says protests will continue until government listens to the community&#8217;s demands. pic.twitter.com/nAdWVpBV8Z &mdash; Mail &amp; Guardian (@mailandguardian) May 10, 2017 A local shop owner was giving loaves of white bread to a group of men and small boys outside of a looted Caltex petrol station despite losing his belongings. For a second, there was a burst of excitement and relief as the young boys took the bread back to their homes. Another store that has been looted at Eldos ext.6 by Caltex.
