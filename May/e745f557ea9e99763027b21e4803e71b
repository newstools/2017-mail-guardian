Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has encouraged young Africans to forge ahead and &#8220;colonise&#8221; the world.&#8220;Go out into the continent and the world and colonise it. Colonise the world with your African talent,&#8221; he said at the African Renaissance Conference in Durban on Thursday.In a speech that steered away from any political rhetoric, Ramaphosa - who is one of the front-runners to take over from President Jacob Zuma as leader of the African National Congress in December - said Africa needed to unite to integrate its economies and trade within the continent.&#8220;Africa will remain vulnerable to international elites, unless it acts against poverty.&#8221;He said Africa was waiting for young people to take over.&#8220;Africa awaits to embrace and support your endeavours, young people. It will be a strong, warm embrace.&#8221;He said Africans had been the first to colonise the world, as the continent was the cradle of humankind.&#8216;Look deep into your DNA&#8217; &#8220;This means that the earliest Africans left the continent and explored the world. They did not limit themselves. The young must think the same.&#8220;Look deep into your DNA and find&#8230; [that] innovative talent that went out to colonise the rest of the world from this continent.&#8221;According to Ramaphosa, imperialism flourished in Africa because the colonialists &#8220;made us believe some of the worst lies&#8221;.&#8220;Through brute force, through the plunder of our resources, the enslavement of minds and bodies - Africans were stripped of their humanity and dignity.&#8221;He said that Africans were reduced to &#8220;unimaginative primitive savages, content with subsistence living&#8221;.&#8220;This conference should be about affirming our collective self-worth as a people and our initiative to develop on our continent. It should be about giving space and opportunity for growth.&#8220;We are the authors of Africa&#8217;s inevitable future. We are not Africans because we are born in Africa, but because Africa is born in us.&#8221; - News24
