President Zuma has survived another motion for him to step down at the ANC national executive committee meeting at the weekend.

Sources within the NEC said 18 members spoke in support of the motion, with 54 against it. The motion, a second in less than a year, was tabled by ANC veteran Joel Netshitendze.
This comes weeks after the ANC’s alliance partners – the South African Communist Party and labour federation Cosatu – called for him to step down as the country’s president following his unpopular Cabinet reshuffle which saw competent ministers sacrificed while under performing ministers remained. The first motion for Zuma to resign was tabled by former tourism minister Derek Hanekom, who was later sacked by Zuma. While Zuma has survived, he still has to face another motion of no confidence by members of Parliament sometime this year. The motion of no confidence in Parliament was tabled by the Democratic Alliance. The impeachment case by the Economic Freedom Fighters is expected to be heard in the Constitutional Court on September 5.

The meeting decided to open the succession debate, with nominations for new leaders only starting in September. The meeting also endorsed the top Six officials’ proposal that the Eskom decision to reappoint Brian Molefe be reversed. The 18 members who supported the motion were:
