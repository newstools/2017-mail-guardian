Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe&#8217;s top aide and government minister has shrugged off charges he is working in cohorts with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema to topple the Zanu-PF strongman.State media on Sunday alleged that Saviour Kasukuwere, the Zanu-PF political commissar, who doubled as the local government minister, was plotting with Malema to stage a coup against Mugabe, 93.Mugabe is currently battling factionalism within the ruling party, as the race to succeed him gets murky.The Sunday Mail, the largest circulating state-owned newspaper, claimed that Kasukuwere and Malema had the backing of a British agent named Lord Robin Renwick. It said that Renwick was the architect of the short-lived administration of Bishop Able Muzorewa in 1978.Renwick, the paper added, was the United Kingdom ambassador to South Africa during apartheid.The report quoted one of Mugabe s provincial ministers Martin Dinha.&#8220;During the meeting convened by advocate Jacob Mudeda, I submitted the allegation that Cde Kasukuwere is working with Julius Malema because they both share the ambition to take over from power from presidents Mugabe and [Jacob] Zuma,&#8221; Dinha told the Sunday Mail, further chronicling how Kasukuwere facilitated Malema s visit to Zimbabwe in 2010.&#8220;...Kasukuwere and Malema see themselves in the same light. They want to run with the idea that the youth are the leaders of tomorrow and tomorrow is today&#8230;,&#8221; Dinha said.But Kasukuwere, who was under fire from a camp which wanted Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa to take over from Mugabe and pushing for the veteran leader to axe him, told News24 the allegations were patently false.&#8220;It&#8217;s nonsense uttered by a deranged mind,&#8221; Kasukuwere said, adding that Dinha was grasping at straws.&#8220;He is helplessly desperate. Someone needs medical help.&#8221;Last week Kasukuwere filed a $1-million lawsuit against Dinha and the state media over allegations he was intent on overthrowing Mugabe.Kasukuwere hinted on Monday that he would institute another legal action over the latest allegations.&#8220;See you in court. He who alleges must prove,&#8221; said Kasukuwere.Efforts to get a comment from the EFF were unsuccessful. &nbsp;News24
