I was covering the rape and murder of three-year-old Courtney Pieters for the Daily Voice. When I went to meet the family, Mortimer, a tenant in the Pieters home for two years and the person accused of having killed her, always had this really concerned look on his face.As a journalist &mdash; or just as person &mdash; one has this idea of what a criminal looks like, you know. But this guy was so clean-cut. Very, very decent. The concern on his face was so real. Whenever I went there, he would be out there with them, searching for Courtney. He would do things like make tea for people and be really supportive. When they held a candlelight vigil, he was there holding his candle and was really, really emotional.&nbsp; When Courtney s mother came back from the morgue, after having to identify her daughter s body, she was in tears. He ran up to her and held her, being a real pillar to the family. I was also hugging her and he came up and touched me on the shoulder. I am not usually comfortable with people touching me, but with him I felt so comfortable. I remember thinking: If I was ever in this position, I would want someone like him around. To be honest, there were a few people in that community that I had suspected &mdash; and this is just taking people at face value &mdash; but never him. I was horrified. Her mom couldn t even speak. This man was someone who lived in their house, someone they had trusted all their lives. I just couldn t believe it. You know, I am usually the kind of person who doesn t trust people too easily, but with him &hellip; Because of this man, I am now questioning every decision I ve ever made. It just shows you can never tell. I can t explain it &hellip; I would just never, ever have suspected him.Saafia February, 36, as told to Carl Collison, the Other Foundation s Rainbow Fellow at the Mail &amp; Guardian.
