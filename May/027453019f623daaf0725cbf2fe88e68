Explosive new detail has emerged to show how the Gupta family used political influence to bag the prized Optimum Coal mine in late 2015 a move that could have resulted in the loss of 35 000 jobs.Former mineral resources minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi has revealed how Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane and the parastatal s controversial chief executive Brian Molefe had allegedly pressurised him to terminate Optimum owners Glencor s mining licenses in the run-up to the sale.Ramatlhodi, in an interview with investigative team&nbsp;amaBhungane, revealed how Ngubane had allegedly threatened to tell President Jacob Zuma of his reluctance to assist during a meeting to discuss Glencore.Shortly after that, Ramatlhodi who said that he refused to comply with their request was shafted as the country s mining minister and moved to Public Service and Administration.Ramatlhodi was also one of the casualties of Zuma s recent Cabinet reshuffle and has since resigned as an MP.AmaBhungane s latest expose contains a detailed chronology of how Eskom had put Glencore under severe pressure to aid the sale of Optimum to the Guptas.This included Eskom s refusal to renegotiate a long-term coal supply contract, forcing the company into business rescue as well as the reinstatement of a disputed R2.17-billion penalty that Optimum supposedly owed for supplying substandard coal.The report, published today, said the suspension of all of Glencore s licenses would have brought Glencore s 14 coal operations to a standstill and risked the jobs of 35 000 employees in South Africa.
