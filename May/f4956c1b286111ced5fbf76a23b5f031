Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has written to speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete to request that an ad hoc committee on state capture be established. Maimane made the announcement on Monday, following news reports over the weekend that revealed emails showing the extent of the Gupta family’s influence in Cabinet. According to Maimane, South Africa is a “mafia state that is dying”. The DA leader said the hoc committee would facilitate a “full” and “extensive” investigation into outsider influence in the national executive and looting by state officials, including President Jacob Zuma.
Parliament has an obligation, Maimane said, to hold the executive to account, and if Mbete decided not to establish the ad hoc committee, the DA would go to court. Maimane said Parliament presented the opportune place where Zuma, the Guptas and ministers allegedly implicated in the emails could appear to explain and answer questions from MPs. The DA’s decision to establish an ad hoc committee comes after a motion of no confidence against Zuma failed on Sunday. Joel Netshitenzhe was backed by 18 NEC members when he tabled the motion on Saturday at the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC).  Although there was no vote, 54 NEC members apparently supported Zuma. Maimane said Luthuli House and the NEC could no longer be trusted to hold the president to account. The DA leader will prepare and complete an affidavit in the next few hours. The DA will press charges against Zuma and his Cabinet as a result of the emails published over the weekend. Although the charges have yet to be finalised, Maimane said the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act will form part of the charge sheet.
