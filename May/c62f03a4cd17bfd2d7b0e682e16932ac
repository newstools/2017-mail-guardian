Dear Arts and Culture,Let me start by commending you for choosing Archbishop Desmond Tutu as the subject of your latest mural on the eastern fa ade of Cape Town s civic centre.I must, however, question the timing of the project.The artwork shrouds my department in complete darkness with a devastating effect on plant life and office morale over the winter months. One would expect better judgement from a well-funded government department such as yourself.Please note this email comes from a place of understanding, but also concern that the entire civic centre might soon be covered in murals.- Sincerely, City PlanningDear City Planning,Thank you for your email outlining concerns around the Desmond Tutu mural.
