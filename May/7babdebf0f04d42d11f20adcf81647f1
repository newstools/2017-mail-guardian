Two men arrested for the alleged murder of a teenage boy in Coligny will appear for an urgent application at the town&#8217;s magistrate&#8217;s court on Tuesday morning.The death was apparently the reason for violent protests in the area, North West premier Supra Mahumapelo said last week.The two men, aged 26 and 33, were charged with murder and appeared in the Coligny Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Friday.The case was initially postponed to May 9, because the magistrate had recused himself.North West regional National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Frank Lesenyego said attorneys for the two suspects lodged an urgent application to the North West High Court to have the bail application date brought forward to May 2.&#8220;The attorneys of the accused brought an application to the High Court of North West requesting the accused be released on bail, [and that] the sitting of court must be transferred to Lichtenburg.&#8221;He said the state only agreed on the date to be brought forward to Tuesday.A magistrate from outside Coligny will be hearing the case, he said.Lesenyego said the state will oppose bail due the recent violent protests.&#8220;The State wants to maintain law and order and for that reason we will oppose bail.&#8221;Residents claimed a farmer assaulted the boy after finding him in his maize field two weeks ago, City Press reported last Tuesday.Other reports allege the boy fell, or was pushed, out of a moving vehicle.Mahumapelo previously called for calm in the Ditsobotla local municipality and assured residents that law and order would be maintained.His statement was issued after shops were looted, and three houses, trucks and a tractor, and an armoured police vehicle were set alight in Coligny and Lichtenburg since the protests started. &nbsp;News24
