Derek Walcott, the poet-chronicler of the island life, died, aged 87, in Saint Lucia, Caribbean, on March 17 after a long illness. He set out to be as transparent and truthful as possible, as he promises earlier on in Islands from In A Green Night (1962), his first serious volume of poetry, which collects his work from 1948 to 1960: I seek, As climate seeks its style, to write Verse crisp as sand, clear as sunlight, Cold as the curled wave, ordinary As a tumbler of island water. He became not only the most distinguished poet and playwright of the English-speaking Caribbean but also one of the great writers of the modern age. He was born Derek Alton, along with his twin Roderick Aldon, to Alix and Warwick Walcott in Castries, Saint Lucia, on January 23 1930 in what was then the British West Indies. They were only a year old when their father died. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present. Please login or&nbsp;consider subscribing.
