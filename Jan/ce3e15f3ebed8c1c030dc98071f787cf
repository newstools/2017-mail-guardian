The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and individuals from Rustenburg&#8217;s platinum belt are using the Fees Must Fall student protests to&nbsp;push their own political agenda, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande said on Thursday.&#8220;There are those who have identified student protests as part of their agenda to disrupt government,&#8221; said Nzimande at a briefing on the department&#8217;s state of readiness for 2017.Asked to elaborate, he said: &#8220;Some are political organisations like the EFF ... Others are some ultra-left expatriate academics who seem to be experimenting.&#8220;Some in Rustenburg&#8217;s platinum belt were identified as common denominators.&#8221;Nzimande added: &#8220;Some political parties who may be dying may be seeing this as an opportunity to revive themselves. I don&#8217;t say more than this.&#8221;&nbsp;He said the government was ready for a possible continuation of Fees Must Fall protests, and had briefed President Jacob Zuma on its state of readiness last year.&nbsp;&#8216;We need rich students&#8217; But he believed that, even if the government made education completely free, there would still be those who were dissatisfied.&nbsp;Nzimande said he was worried that some parents were sending their children to universities overseas, instead of local ones, to avoid cancelled classes and delayed exams owing to fees-related protests.&nbsp;This included parents from other African countries who had traditionally sent their children to South Africa to study.&nbsp;&#8220;We cannot afford to drive away rich students,&#8221; said Nzimande, &#8220;because we need their money in order to subsidise poor students for that matter.&#8221;There had also been a sudden interest in starting private universities in South Africa, because a gap in the market had been created.Nzimande estimated that the protests had cost around R1-billion in damage so far and said he hoped that a permanent solution would be found in 2017.Gear to blame He implored students not to be provoked into violence.&#8220;If you are being provoked, why then burn a library and, in Mahikeng, destroy a state-of-the-art science laboratory?&#8221;He said he understood what the students were going through and blamed the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) plan, a former government policy that was&nbsp;replaced in 2005 because it had not provided adequate funding for all aspects of education in the immediate years after apartheid.&#8220;This is the year in which we hope this issue of fees will be addressed in one way or another,&#8221; Nzimande said. The Fees Must Fall protests appeared to take the government by surprise in October 2015 when thousands of students stormed Parliament during the medium-term budget speech of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene.&nbsp;Weeks of clashes with police followed and Zuma announced that proposed fee increases would be frozen. For 2017, fee increases were capped at 8%, with another fee freeze for poor students and students from families with a joint income of less than R600 000. A fees commission was also established to examine controversial issues involving university fees and funding. -&nbsp;News24
