He received an international prosecutors award for his successful prosecution of Selebi, who also headed Interpol, on charges of corruption.Nel was the chief prosecutor in the State s murder case against former Paralympic champion Pistorius. In 2015 the Supreme Court of Appeal changed Pistorius s culpable homicide conviction to murder.In 2008 Nel was arrested on trumped-up fraud charges while pursuing Selebi. It later emerged that suspended deputy NPA head, Nomgcobo Jiba, was instrumental in securing an arrest warrant against Nel.In 2011 City Press reported that Jiba s hostility against Nel was caused by his involvement in a fraud case against her husband, Booker Nhantsi.Nhantsi, a former lawyer and Scorpions investigator, was jailed for stealing money from his law firm s trust account. President Jacob Zuma later expunged Nhantsi s criminal record.Nicknamed the bulldog prosecutor, Nel is a former provincial wrestler who teaches the sport to schoolchildren.News24 has also reported that Nel will be joining AfriForum to pursue private prosecutions on their behalf.
