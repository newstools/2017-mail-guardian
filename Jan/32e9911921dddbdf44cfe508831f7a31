Oh it was grand, our year of 2017 In politics there were things we had never ever seen The ANC had been due to rule “until Jesus returns” And so voter sentiment had not been one of its concerns Now the party found itself in deep, deep trouble Even if some of its leaders still lived in a bubble The party stalwarts again stepped to the fore But still their “interference” the top brass did abhor The veterans warned that the looting had to stop This was dismissed again as just so much agitprop So it was that the great battle was joined (For which resources that belong to the public were incidentally purloined) Out stepped one Dlamini-Zuma, for the current administration While Cyril Ramaphosa said he too could, you know, lead the whole nation They lobbied behind closed doors, their intentions ill-declared “You can’t look like you want it too much” they were told, like anyone cared So they danced around the issues, they spoke in metaphor Each not wanting to criticise the other, it hardly approached a hot war Behind Dlamini-Zuma stood the government’s propaganda apparatus Poor Ramaphosa had to make do with his deputy presidential status For Nkosazana there were awards, and speeches domestic Many an opportunity for her to look well and truly majestic Poor Cyril, still at his boss’s pleasure and behest Found that his schedule was suddenly very, very stressed Any event that would make him look presidential Would be cancelled in favour of matters inconsequential “We really need you to cut this shopping-mall ribbon.” “The press? We forgot to invite ’em!” he’d be told in tones mock-stricken So the one spent much time out in the public eye And got all the airtime that GCIS for her could buy The other was made to play the behind-the-scenes servant Which did not go unnoticed by ANC members observant “One of them seems to be much in the public spotlight,” They would muse at their important next plebiscite “The other toils without cease though he’s rich as a rogue.” And this, they thought, is something that should be much in vogue So it was that the whole plan backfired Though not before public money was on it squandered How it all ended you of course remember Gosh, didn’t 2017 have just the most exciting December? There was an organisation with offices in Auckland Park For quite a long time it had been run by a monarch He sat on his throne and issued decrees He never said “thank you”, he never said “please” Eventually, in disgust, his bosses left or were fired So a new group to oversee it was greatly desired This hiring job was left up to the legislature Because never before at such work had it known failure The House debated, the House contemplated The House looked at CVs, the House people rated This being politics though, they could not refrain And (we guess from the outcome), fell to politicians’ bane Yes, we think they tippled, yes they must have got into the booze Because how the hell else did they again manage to appoint a board full of yahoos? They called him a sheep, they laughed in his face But Shaun was not daunted, he stayed on the case He knew there is evil in this world, and some had been done At least some of it — he knew! — by that man called Gordhan He searched for it high, he searched for it low There was nothing he wouldn’t do, there ain’t nowhere he didn’t go He called all his friends and begged them for evidence He went to former colleagues and offered to pay them severance He dug through the trash, he studied the law Even though of vu there was oh so much déjà He looked in the corners, he turned over rocks He made all his people pull up their socks How can this be? Is there nothing to find? No! Don’t give up Shaun, don’t let them mess with your mind! He had a tough year, the man they called a sheep With all the work he missed way too much beauty sleep His eyebrows they wilted, his sparkle he lost It all came at a terrible mental cost But then, just as he seemed to be losing his grip Along came a most fortuitously empty ambassadorship! Shaun now lives happy, Shaun’s life is great As is always the case when you pick the right mate. They had lots of money, the family in Saxonwold They’d made lots of deals, they’d mined lots of gold So good where they that they were universally admired Until against them everyone suddenly conspired The media, white capital, even the banks All the nasty rats started gnawing at their flanks Of course they fought back, they did what they could Against all barbs and arrows determined they stood And, behold! As if from nowhere there arose A group of defenders, emerging from the shadows They created new websites, they tweeted up a storm Saying “don’t believe all this nonsense, it’s just racist form” So many were there, all of a sudden And still they continued to flood in But the attacks would not cease, nor the victimisation With their lies the evil (other) capitalists turned much of the nation So the family said “screw this” and their assets they sold They even gave up their famous Johannesburg stronghold They took all their money, they got on their jets They left behind Africa, and all of its threats To greener pastures they went, in far-off Dubai Where no one their wealth, or how obtained, would decry South Africa, still trying to figure out how the state had been captured Said “come back, let’s talk”, but of this idea they were not enamoured What a great loss to the country it has been To have lost a family so hard-working, healthy and clean.
