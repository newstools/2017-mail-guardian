These were appointments made by the chief executives, thanks to the amendment, instead of the board.&#8216;Muthambi should be fired&#8217;MPs also discussed recommendations around the &#8220;shareholder&#8221; of the SABC, which is currently Minister Muthambi.Opposition MPs were very critical of Muthambi&#8217;s role in the dissolution of the current board.EFF MP Fana Mokoena suggested that the report recommend to President Jacob Zuma that Muthambi be fired for her role at the SABC since 2014.Both Mokoena and DA MP Phumzile van Damme said the amendments she made to the memorandum of incorporation should be reversed, and Muthambi&#8217;s current wish to amend the Broadcasting Act this year should be examined by Parliament.ANC MP Hlomane Chauke tried to check talk of Muthambi&#8217;s proposed dismissal, and suggested that the committee should craft a more watertight suggestion regarding the role of the minister to send to the president.He was supported by fellow ANC member Kilian, although Kilian felt that Muthambi&#8217;s suggested amendments to the Broadcasting Act should not be expedited, and that Parliament needs to look at the amendments closely.MPs were unanimous that the Broadcasting Act needs to trump the Company&#8217;s Act, they said.DeadlineDA MP Mike Waters said the committee should write to Parliament&#8217;s ethics committee to report Muthambi&#8217;s conduct as a sworn-in MP.He also suggested that criminal charges be laid against her with regards to her alleged breach of the Powers, Privileges and Immunities Act of Parliament.He was supported by the ACDP&#8217;s Steve Swart who said the buck stops with the minister, and &#8220;she must be held accountable&#8221;.Committee chairperson Vincent Smith was keen to stress that all suggestions made this week were just that, and would only hold legal weight once accepted by the National Assembly in late February.The committee will send its final report to the SABC and affected parties on January 28.It will expect rebuttal and response from the SABC by February 16, which will be added to the report for consolidation by February 21.The National Assembly has until February 28 to adopt a final report. -&nbsp;News24
