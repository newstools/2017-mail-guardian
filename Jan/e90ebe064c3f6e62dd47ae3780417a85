Last May, then-public protector Thuli Madonsela sat down with former president Thabo Mbeki for what would turn out to be a confrontational interview.They asked each other questions about government s role back in the late 1990s in deciding what steps to take to recover monies given as illicit gifts to Bankorp (now Absa).Two weeks ago, the&nbsp;Mail and Guardian exclusively reported that mega-bank Absa&nbsp;could be forced to pay R2.25 billion to the fiscus for an unlawful apartheid-era bank bailout if the public protector&#8217;s preliminary report remains unchanged.Last week, we reported on&nbsp;Mbeki s interview with Madonsela.
