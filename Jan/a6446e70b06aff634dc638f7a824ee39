THEESatisfaction s awE NaturalE: This hip-hop duo no longer exists as a musical act but this album, their debut released in 2012, is slowly starting to reveal its hidden nooks and crannies. If the whole thing doesn t work for you, trust that the 1-2 combo of QueenS followed Existinct will knock you out cold. (KS)Eric Lau s Soundcloud: Having met the music producer as part of the Page 3 feature on him, I ve been tuned into his Soundcloud account, in the hands of a man who has a heady mix that includes De La Soul and the Boiler Room DJ Set. I ve had a very Zen sonic week at https://soundcloud.com/ericlaumusic (MB)Bren Brown s The Gifts of Imperfection: Trying to practise compassion and courage and training your mind to do better can sometimes lead you to the self-helpy aisles of Amazon.com &mdash; aisles that can destroy one s street cred. But we are also the same people who project perfect exterior lives while our interior lives are in burn-slow turmoil. I m not far into Brown s book, a first-person guide on how compassion, courage and connection can be deployed to every situation in our everyday lives. (MB)Mark Fisher s Capitalist&nbsp;Realism: Is There No&nbsp;Alternative: Mark Fisher, author, blogger (k-punk) and cultural critic, died recently. This thing of celebrating people only when they are dead really sucks. But I m more interested in you reading the above-mentioned book. Here, Fisher brings the rampant march of capitalism to stark reality, melding pop-culture references and academic theory to slap you upside the head. (KS)
