FAKA have always come across as artists for whom sound defines a large part of their practice. Formed by friends Desire Marea and Fela Gucci, FAKA first released beatless audio meditations with self-shot footage emphasising location, styling and the interactions between them, as well as improvisational movement. The naked human voice formed the basis of the audio work, taking cues and influences from South African genre staples as shorthand for their narratives. While being grounded in styles of music with which the country is familiar might make it seem like their work should sit comfortably within its boundaries, FAKA’s approach ensures that this isn’t the case.
