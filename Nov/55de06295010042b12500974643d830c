Athi-Patra Ruga’s work involves a communal process of weaving together personal and shared histories, moving towards the formation of a new universe or perhaps a new understanding of this old one. In his new solo show, Queens in Exile, at the WhatifTheWorld Gallery in Cape Town, Ruga’s tapestries recall the collective practice of the Rorke’s Drift women, headed by Allina Ndebele and Jessie Dlamini, who created the large-scale, intricately woven artworks that kept the KwaZulu-Natal art centre afloat until the 1980s.  Ruga’s work demands the nuanced attention, imagination and knowledge brought to it by its audience, and refuses to offer easily consumable representations that flatten identities into subjects whose sum total is only defined through predetermined gender and race constructs.
