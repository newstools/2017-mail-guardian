The serious rape allegation made by Sibongile Promise Khumalo, a former Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) operative, against Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) leader Potlako Leballo (Women freedom fighters tell of sexual abuse in camps) is regrettable and, at face value, untrue. We don’t dispute the fact that Khumalo was raped at some time in her life by someone we don’t know, or that she left the country at age 14, or that she was in military camps in Mozambique. Nor do we dispute that she was in Tripoli, Libya, at about the age of 15, or that she was once in Tanzania for military training. The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania sympathises with her in all the suffering she experienced in exile as a child, then as a woman. She did not deserve to be treated thus.
