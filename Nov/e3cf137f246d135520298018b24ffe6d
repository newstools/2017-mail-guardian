Flotsam by Caryn Scrimeour. Why do we collect and arrange miscellaneous objects and trinkets in an attempt to fill them with significance and meaning? Caryn Scrimgeour’s exhibition tries to answer these questions. Delicate chinaware, glassware and insects are combined with common trinkets and knick-knacks and portrayed against a backdrop of richly patterned fabric in a way that is reminiscent of 17th-century Dutch still-life painting.
Details: The exhibition is open until November 25 at Circa on Jellicoe Gallery in Johannesburg. Everything Must Go by Anastasia Pather. This is the Johannesburg-based artist’s second solo exhibition.
