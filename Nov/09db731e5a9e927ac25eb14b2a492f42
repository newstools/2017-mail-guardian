Former discredited Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe and former chairperson Zola Tsotsi will testify at the parliamentary inquiry into the state power utility on Tuesday. Both Molefe and Tsotsi have been mentioned several times during the hearings, and now face damning allegations of wrongdoing. Molefe, who has been linked to the Gupta family in the public protector’s state capture report, has been accused of helping the family secure coal contracts with Eskom for one of their companies. He has also allegedly facilitated the family’s bid to acquire Optimum Coal Mine from Glencore. Molefe was once hailed for bringing more stability to Eskom, but has since become highly criticised for his relationship with the Gupta family.
He resigned from Eskom following the release of the State of Capture report. It was then revealed he received a R30-million “pension” payout, which has since been rescinded. Molefe has now controversially been appointed a position in the SANDF. Tuesday will mark the first time he has had to appear in Parliament to answer on his conduct and leadership at Eskom. Tsotsi will also face difficult questions as allegations have mounted that the former chairperson was “facing pressure from outside”, according to former finance director Tsholofelo Molefe.  Tsotsi has also been accused of unfairly interfering in due process at the power utility, particularly in choosing candidates to work in his office when Eskom processes said otherwise. Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Deputy Minister Ben Martins are also set to appear at the inquiry this week. Matshela Koko, the suspended executive who has been at the center of a disciplinary hearing at Eskom, is also expected to testify in the coming days.
