Eskom acting chief executive Johnny Dladla has been removed from the power utility after four months in his post. TimesLive reported that the Eskom board had removed Dladla to find a permanent group chief executive to fill the role. In an internal staff memo, which TimesLive quotes, Eskom chairperson Zethembe Khoza says: “...in an effort to embed organisational stability‚ it is imperative that the role of Eskom Group Chief Executive be permanently filled.”  Dladla became acting chief executive at Eskom in June 2017 after former chief executive Mathsela Koko was suspended.  His removal comes a day after Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown met with the Eskom board.
 Dladla has not, however, been fired by Eskom. He will return to his previous position as chief executive of Eskom Rotek Industries. Sean Maritz, the Eskom’s head of information and information technology will be interim group chief executive.  “The Eskom Board has decided to rotate current executives in this role to ensure exposure.” “This note serves to inform you that the Eskom Board has appointed Mr Sean Maritz as the interim Group CEO‚ effective immediately,” TimesLive quotes the memo.
