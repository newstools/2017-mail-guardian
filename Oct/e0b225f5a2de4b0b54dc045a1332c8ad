A 29-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the alleged rape and assault of two students at Nelson Mandela University. The incident was in a computer lab at the Second Avenue campus in Summerstrand, Port Elizabeth, by an intruder who gained access to the campus. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the man had been arrested in Govan Mbeki Avenue shortly after 15:00 on Wednesday. Naidu said the police’s Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Investigations unit had been working around the clock since the incident and had been following up on information that had led to the man’s arrest. CCTV footage also circulated on social media and showed a man wearing an orange sweater and light denims.
In one image, he appears to be buttoning up his jeans, while in the other he can be seen leaving the computer lab, opening the door while wearing yellow latex kitchen gloves. “The FCS unit, assisted by members of the flying squad, arrested the suspect in Govan Mbeki Avenue, in possession of the stolen computer and the victim’s cellphone,” she said. Naidu said the man had apparently been on his way to sell the computer when he was arrested. The suspect is expected to appear in court on Friday on charges of rape and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
