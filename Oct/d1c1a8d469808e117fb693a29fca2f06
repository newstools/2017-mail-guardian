The minister of finance, Malusi GiGupta, cut a pathetic and unconvincing figure on Wednesday as he delivered a medium-term budget policy statement that simply confirms the consequences of state capture.

GiGupta pretended as though numbers have their own agency.

But that is a trick we cannot fall for.
