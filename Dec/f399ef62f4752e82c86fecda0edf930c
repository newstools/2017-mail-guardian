The current system of allocating police resources is discriminatory, the Western Cape High Court heard this week. Civil society organisations the Social Justice Coalition, Equal Education and the Nyanga Community Policing Forum have applied to the court to declare that the allocation of police resources in the Western Cape discriminates against black and poor people, and black women in particular. In question is the Theoretical Human Resource Requirements (THRR), a complex and secretive system that establishes how police and staff are allocated. The applicants say it needs to be overhauled. It is meant to look at reported crime rates and environmental factors that facilitate or impede effective policing. Advocate Michael Bishop, for the applicants, told the court they wanted the system to be overhauled, with public participation about how it should work.
