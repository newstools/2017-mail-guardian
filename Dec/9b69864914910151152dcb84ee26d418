A mere 340 companies are responsible for the majority of tax contributions made by the corporate sector. As with personal income tax, this narrow company tax base is under increasing economic pressure, and corporate income tax contributions have declined as the share of overall tax revenue fell from 26.7% almost a decade ago to 18.1% currently. This is according the latest statistics released on Tuesday by the South African Revenue Service (Sars). But tax compliance by both individuals and companies has emerged as a key problem in raising revenue. Sars is seeking tougher tools, including the reintroduction of tax courts, to curb noncompliance. Further evidence of declining company contributions is revealed by the company income tax to gross domestic product ratio, which dropped from 6.9% to 4.7% in the past 10 years. According to the statistics, Sars collected R207-billion in company tax for the 2016-2017 tax year.
