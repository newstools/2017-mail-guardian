There’s a scene in the first episode of She’s Gotta Have It — the 10-episode remake of the original Spike Lee film — in which Mars Blackmon, having been allowed into Nola Darling’s Fort Greene brownstone for the first time, gawks at an unfinished portrait of Malcolm X. She tells Mars that she and Malcolm share a birthday, May 19. The scene serves as a reminder of the time that has passed between the 1986 film, Lee’s directorial debut, and now. The lovers discuss Denzel Washington’s portrayal of Malcolm X in the 1992 Lee-directed biopic and the actor being robbed of the Academy Award.
