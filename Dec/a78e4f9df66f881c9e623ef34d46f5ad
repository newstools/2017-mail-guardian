The Gibson Kente Music Tribute: The Soweto Theatre is proud to announce a three-week musical tribute to culture luminary and godfather of South Africa theatre Gibson Kente. Plays such as How Long?, I Believe and Too Late, among many others, spoke to the heart of what black South Africans experienced under a foreign and repressive regime. It is from the townships that he and other legends have influenced the cultural, economic and political landscape of South Africa. Details: The tribute will continue until December 17. Tickets are R120 and are available at webticket.co.za  Queens in Exile by Athi-Patra Ruga: This exhibition isn’t simply a revisionist exercise, patching up inconvenient holes in the historical record. Instead, Ruga excavates collective memory and exclusionary national myth to rebuild both in wholly new shapes — to make a world where the exiled can reign. The result is a land of many queens, lost and found and forgotten. Details: WHATIFTHEWORLD, 1  Argyle Street, Woodstock, Cape Town, until January 27. Admission is free.  Am i Free: The idea that freedom has been attained floats in the minds of many, yet people still lack a common understanding of what it truly means. In the current South Africa, people are fighting each other and lives are being lost for trying to attain what they have voted for. Through dance and theatre, this play explores the meaning and responsibilities that come with the idea of freedom. Details: The State Theatre, 320 Pretorius Street, Pretoria, until December 10. Tickets are R80. For more information visit statetheatre.co.za
