Axed Mogale City mayor Michael Holenstein has claimed the ANC bribed council members to support a motion against him. Holenstein, a Democratic Alliance member, was removed as mayor after a motion of no confidence against him was conducted by secret ballot. The motion was passed with a majority of one single vote. The DA, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) were all opposed to the motion being conducted by secret ballot. At national level, all three parties have been calling for a secret ballot for the proposed motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. The three opposition parties support the United Democratic Movement s application to the Constitutional Court seeking an order that the Constitution would allow a secret ballot on the motion.
