EFF leader Julius Malema has officially opened a case regarding President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s and finance minister Malusi Gigaba&#8217;s roles in a Transnet tender which he accuses the rail company of inflating the price of locomotive prices by R11-million. Addressing a crowd of EFF supporters outside JHB Central Police Station, Malema said he was not there to oppose Zuma, but that &#8220;we&#8217;re protecting the poor African masses&#8221;. &#8220;If these limited resources are used for the benefit of the few, particularly the politically well-connected individuals, then we&#8217;re guaranteed the ordinary masses of our people will continue to suffer.&#8221;Malema addressing the crowd now pic.twitter.com/4AacvddYVZ&mdash; Caroline Vakil (@CarolineVakil) June 9, 2017 Malema also called on the ANC to act against those involved in corruption. He said he will also be reaching out to American, Canadian and Chinese governments to look into these allegations. He suggested that if the World Bank and IMF are working with these companies, they investigate them, too. The EFF says the case number is CAS 384/6/2017.
