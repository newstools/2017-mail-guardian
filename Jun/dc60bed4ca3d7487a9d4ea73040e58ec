FAKA: Uyang khumbula. I legit feel like I ve eureka d the answers to every single unanswered question in life. I ve been listening to FAKA s new single, Uyang khumbula, and gagging over every bit of the gqom beat, the salacious and naughty lyrics and, of course, the duo s looks in the video. I don t know how they manage to turn the most banal of settings and smise the ugly out of them. Their outfits look like they were pinched from Diana Ross s and Sun Ra s washing lines. (MB)Iverson (Netflix). In some quarters, the name Allen Iverson no longer gets respect. It is easy to forget the slightly built six-footer because he never won a National Basketball Association championship, but the man had a heart bigger than most. If we won t give him his props for his killer crossover and singular attitude, at least let s agree that his low-slung jeans, Timberlands and cornrows (frowned on by commissioner David Stern, leading to a change in dress code rules) are the reason NBA players dress so weirdly these days. (KS)The Coup: Entire discographyThe trees we got lifted by made our feet dangle/ So when I say burn one I mean Star Spangled. This section from Ghetto Manifesto is typical Boots Riley. His career is full of lyrical darts and his beats channel funk in all its guises. Yes, the entire discography. (KS)Koleka Putuma: Collective Amnesia. I ve read this poetry anthology cover to cover more than once. It s one of those generational reference books that I ve made notes in and will keep going back to for years to come. Nothing about South Africa escapes Putuma s 24-year-old eye. She knows us and brilliantly lists the number of hurts we still have to finish with both the firm hand of truth and the promise that love will still remain, even if we don t believe it s here. (MB)The Lists are compiled by Friday editor Milisuthando Bongela and arts writer Kwanele Sosibo
