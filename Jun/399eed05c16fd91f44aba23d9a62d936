Describing Imam Mohamed Mahmoud as a &#8220;hero&#8221;, Qasimi said: &#8220;People started hitting him hard and Mohamed took so many punches because he was protecting the guy until the police arrived&#8221;.Qasimi blamed Islamophobia for the attack, saying: &#8220;This guy was extreme right wing, trying to kill Muslims because they are Muslims. This is a clear hate crime. We ask the government to do more to protect us Muslims.&#8221;
