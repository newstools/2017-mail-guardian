Eskom board chairperson Ben Ngubane has resigned with immediate effect.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown announced Ngubane s resignation as both non-executive director and chairperson of the parastatal s board late on Monday night. Dr Ngubane formally tendered his resignation, which I accepted, Brown, said in a statement. I would like to thank Dr Ngubane for his contribution to turning Eskom around since the load shedding days of 2014-15, and wish him well in the future.&#8221;To ensure continuity at Eskom, Brown appointed&nbsp;Mr Zethembe Khoza as interim chairperson until she is able&nbsp;to take new board appointments to Cabinet for approval.Ngubane has been under a cloud&nbsp;since former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela released her&nbsp;&#8216;State of Capture&#8217; report implicating him in alleged improper dealings. Twice, Ngubane has been mentioned in the Gupta email leaks.Recently, Ngubane dismissed allegations by former Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi that he attempted to force him to&nbsp;suspend the mining licences of coal supplier Glencore.Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma said, It shocked me personally and I know a couple of guys I spoke to were also shocked. I don t think they expected him the resignation to happen. Eskom s annual general meeting will be held later this month.
