Delegates to the ANC’s policy conference should take a break from political posts on social media if they want to stay out of trouble - and will have little room to do anything other than what’s already on the agenda, according to the plenary procedure and code of conduct. The other usual rules include a three-minute cap on the time each delegate can speak, no booing, howling or whistling or singing of derogatory songs against ANC or alliance leaders and their guests. There is also a ban on raising any business which does not arise from the policy discussion documents. The restrictions on social media include preventing delegates from posting information emanating from the closed policy sessions and the expectation that they “carefully consider the content and political risks of posting, sharing, sending or resending of any information from open sessions.” More broadly: “No comrades may post on social media any communication that may be of an insulting nature, derogatory or cause unnecessary harm to the ANC and any of its members,” the code of conduct reads The sanction for any of these offences is disciplinary action.
