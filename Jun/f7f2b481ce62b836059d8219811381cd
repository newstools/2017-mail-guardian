The Eskom board announced on Thursday that&nbsp;it had appointed Johnny Dladla as acting chief executive of the power utility.Dladla has 22 years of experience in the company, and has spent the last five years as chief executive of Eskom Enterprises, Eskom said in a statement.The wholly owned subsidiary provides, among other things, construction and transportation services to Eskom through Eskom Rotek Industries, as well as housing Eskom s operations in Uganda.Dladla s appointment comes after a series of leadership crises at the power utility.Eskom has been without a chief executive since the brief, if controversial, return of Brian Molefe on May 15. Molefe did not last the month because Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown instructed the board to rescind his reinstatement, after a public outcry and&nbsp;court challenges by opposition parties and trade unions.Molefe is, in return, challenging his removal in the Labour Court.The appointment followed intense consultations between Brown and the board.Brown welcomed the appointment saying it would bring further stability to Eskom and its executive team .The parastatal is still on the hunt for a permanent leader.Dladla is a Fort Hare University graduate and a chartered marketer.The announcement comes just ahead of Eskom s annual general meeting on Friday, where Brown is is expected to rotate the remaining Eskom board.Last week, following in the wake of Molefe s re-appointment fracas, former board chairperson Ben Ngubane resigned.Eskom executive Matshela Koko was appointed as acting chief executive&nbsp;after Molefe exited Eskom in the wake of the Public Protector s State of Capture report. But when allegations emerged that his step-daughter s company had&nbsp;benefited from lucrative Eskom contracts, he was suspended while law firm Cliff Dekker Hofmeyer investigated the claims.
