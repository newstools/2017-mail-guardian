Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and&nbsp;Bahrain severed their ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist groups, opening up the worst rift in years among some of the most powerful states in the Arab world.The&nbsp;coordinated move dramatically escalated a dispute over Qatar&#8217;s support of the&nbsp;Muslim Brotherhood, the world&#8217;s oldest Islamic movement, and added accusations that Doha even backs the agenda of regional rival&nbsp;Iran.Announcing the closure of transport ties with Qatar, the three Gulf states gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their countries.Qatar was also expelled from a Saudi-led coalition fighting in&nbsp;Yemen.Economic disturbances loomed immediately, as Abu Dhabi&#8217;s state-owned Etihad Airways, Dubai-based Emirates and flydubai said they would suspend all flights to and from Doha from Tuesday morning until further notice.The measures are more severe than during a previous eight-month rift in 2014, when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the&nbsp;UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, again alleging Qatari support for armed groups. At that time, travel links were maintained and Qataris were not expelled.A split between Doha and its closest allies can have repercussions around the&nbsp;Middle East, where Gulf states have used their financial and political power to influence events in&nbsp;Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.The announcements come 10 days after President Donald Trump visited Riyadh to call on Muslim countries to stand united against armed groups, and singling out Iran as a key source of funding and support for armed groups.Here is a timeline of the recent main events that led to the escalation of disputes between the GCC nations.
