Vardospan Limited s owners must have known they stood little chance of getting a court order to rush through approval to buy Habib Overseas Bank by close of business on Friday.Perhaps they went to court just in case President Jacob Zuma couldn t pull the proverbial trigger on a unilateral Cabinet reshuffle.By Friday morning, even though their case was dismissed with costs, Vardospan s owners Hamza Farooqui and Salim Essa, were safe in the knowledge that their biggest obstacle was out of the way.With Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, fired, incoming Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba could be tempted to make significant staff changes at national treasury &mdash; and possibly at regulatory institutions such as the Registrar of Banks.The question now is whether Gigaba will rely on the court papers setting out the government s case as a blueprint for a decision on this. Or, would he want to tick it off from his to-do list as quickly as he can?By all accounts this is a tiny deal, but Farooqui and Essa seek control of a bank, a process that usually takes four years. They ve been at it for just seven months and they have either become impatient or desperate.Farooqui, billing himself as a crusader for a black-owned bank, chose an interesting partner in Salim Essa, a known Gupta ally.And the timing of their deal coincided perfectly with the heat the Guptas were feeling, as major banks had shut their accounts. The company s urgent court bid to force a commitment out of the regulator revealed a number of factors that appear to justify the need for proper due diligence.First, the law ordinarily stipulates a minimum four-year period for someone to go from owning a 0% stake in a bank to anything above 74% &mdash; and with fresh regulatory approval after each year.It requires due diligence on the finances of the new owners to ensure the protection of customers and the broader banking system.Second, it requires regulators to be satisfied that those who seek to run the bank are fit and proper . Court papers suggest red flags on both fronts: Vardospan had failed to provide audited financial statements of three companies linked to Essa, upon whose financial strength the application appears to rest.Affidavits by treasury director general Lungisa Fuzile and one by the Registrar of Banks, Kuben Naidoo, highlight concerns about Essa. They point out his involvement in Gupta-linked businesses, Tegeta Exploration and Resources, Trillian Capital Partners and VR Laser Services &mdash; all of which were named in the State of Capture report.Fuzile said, without satisfying himself that there are no grounds for suspicion of Mr Essa or the three companies, the minister cannot approve the application.Then there is the need to interrogate the bona fides of the bank s new executives who include two current Trillian executives: Tebogo Leballo and Faheema Badat.One of the other potential executives is a relative of Trillian s Eric Wood &mdash; Wood is the man who allegedly couldn t show his face at national treasury days after the firing of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene because he had been exposed for allegedly having had prior knowledge of that catastrophic move by Zuma.Vardospan intends to continue with legal proceedings in the quest to create South Africa s first black-owned bank.
