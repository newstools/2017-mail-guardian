Calling the minister back was not an issue for the NEC,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There can be nothing in the NEC that can be linked to calling the minister back. That is a government matter. Is it because there was no permission? We are not aware. &nbsp;The rand has dipped against a weak dollar and euro since news of the cancelled trip broke this morning.
