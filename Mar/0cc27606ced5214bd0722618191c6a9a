From chiselling into safe rooms to drugging security guards, South Africa s most high-profile heists are the stuff movies are made of.On Tuesday night, robbers made off with an estimated R24-million in what appeared to be a well-planned robbery possibly involving police, at OR Tambo International Airport.The robbery is not the first at OR Tambo International Airport. In the second half of 2001, at the then-Johannesburg International Airport, $6.5-million was stolen from a Swissair cargo plane, and almost $10-million from a KLM cargo plane.This, however, is only a quarter of the amount stolen during the country s biggest robbery 11 years ago.Here s a list of the most notorious heists over the past 20 years:R100-million On March 25, 2006, a gang of 24 men armed with AK-47s stole R100-million in cash from an SAA plane at OR Tambo International Airport.They held up police officers and guards after the flight landed and helped themselves to bags of currency flown in from Britain.It was later discovered that airport staff had helped plan it. After a six-year trial, seven suspects were tried and sentenced for their involvement in the heist.R87-million On the night of April 27 2014, an armed gang overpowered and drugged security guards at an SBV cash centre in Witbank.They cut open a safe and stole R87-million.

Sixteen of them were convicted.R8-million Last month, six robbers stole jewellery worth R8m from a man shortly after he landed at Cape Town International Airport, despite having an escort of four private security guards.The victim had bought the jewellery at an auction in Johannesburg.
