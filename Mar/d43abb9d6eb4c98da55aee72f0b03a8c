During his campaign for the White House, Trump pledged to undo many of Obama&#8217;s signature policy measures, including his healthcare law.Obama, who campaigned for Trump&#8217;s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has sought to ensure a smooth transition of power despite major policy differences with his successor. He also leaves his party without a clear figurehead as he leaves the White House.&#8220;Since 2009, we&#8217;ve faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger,&#8221; Obama said in the email, likely foreshadowing a theme for his speech.&#8220;That&#8217;s because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding - our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better.&#8221; - Reuters
