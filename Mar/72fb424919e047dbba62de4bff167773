Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini received a hero&#8217;s welcome on Monday&nbsp;at a South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) briefing&nbsp;in Cape Town&nbsp;on the grants crisis.Hero&#8217;s welcome at Cape Town #Sassa event for Social Development Minister Bathabile #Dlamini @News24 pic.twitter.com/mEVuPU2fxx&mdash; Jenni Evans (@itchybyte) March 6, 2017Delegates welcomed her with songs, hugs and applause.This was in stark contrast to the heavy criticism she has faced&nbsp;over the chaos and confusion regarding a new&nbsp;social&nbsp;grant payments system before the end of March. From April 1, the current&nbsp;Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) contract ends; it was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court in 2014 but extended so that the department had time to make another payment&nbsp;arrangement&nbsp;to millions of people on Sassa&#8217;s behalf.Dlamini, who was slightly late for the 3pm&nbsp;briefing, was expected to address&nbsp;the group, which comprised nongovernmental organisations, traditional leaders and the clergy, about&nbsp;the payment of grants.But women in elaborate head scarves and traditional dresses kept on singing .After Dlamini took to the stage, a hymn was sung and proceedings began.The minister has said that grant recipients will be paid on April 1 through the extension of CPS&#8217;s contract for at least another two years.Lobby group Black Sash has asked the Constitutional Court to oversee any new arrangement and also for details of the contract extension. -&nbsp;News24
