Economic Freedom Fighters commander-in-chief Julius Malema will head to the Constitutional Court today in a bid to have impeachment proceedings instituted against President Jacob Zuma. In a statement, the party said it&#8217;s leader will file an application at 2.30pm requesting the court to force Parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete to begin disciplinary&nbsp;or impeachment processes against the president.If application is successful, Baleka Mbete will have no option but to put Zuma on trial so that he can answer directly to the people of SA.&mdash; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) March 30, 2017 The EFF says it has been left no choice but to approach the Concourt&nbsp;due to the inaction taken against Zuma over the Nkandla scandal.&nbsp; &#8220;Tomorrow is exactly one year since the Concourt handed down its historic judgment in the EFF&#8217;s Nkandla application. Since then, we have made numerous appeals and wrote several letters to the Speaker of Parliament. All have fallen on deaf ears and have been met with violence by Parliament on EFF MPs,&#8221; the EFF said in the statement. &#8220;We approach the Constitutional Court as a last resort based on the belief that Zuma&#8217;s conduct around the Nkandla matter, both inside and outside of Parliament, renders him unfit to hold the high office of President of the Republic of South Africa.&#8221;
