The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation confirmed the news about the iconic activist on their Twitter account shortly after 5.30am today. Kathrada was admitted to hospital on March 4 for surgery related to blood clotting in the brain. The foundation&#8217;s director, Neeshan Balton, said in a statement that Kathrada had &#8220;experienced several health-related setbacks making the prognosis of his illness unpredictable&#8221;. The 87-year-old had initially been admitted to hospital for dehydration and exhaustion, but doctors later picked up the clot, which was removed. Last week he contracted pneumonia. According to the foundation, Kathrada insisted on a &#8220;simple&#8221; funeral, refusing a state funeral.
