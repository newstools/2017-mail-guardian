COMMENTIt s&nbsp;International Women s Day and I am struggling with many emotions. I am opening the fourth invitation in as many days to an embassy roundtable on women s rights in Southern Africa, and I am tempted to request politely that they donate the lunch or breakfast money to our work on the ground.I have spent the past few days visiting rural councils in Madagascar that have elected to become centres of excellence (COEs) for gender in local government.&nbsp;Gender Links works with more than 400 such councils in 10 Southern African countries.
