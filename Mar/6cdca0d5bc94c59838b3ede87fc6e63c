This week saw the death of filmmaker John Volmink. He began his career at JP Morgan as an investment banking analyst before founding Diprente Films with Kagiso Lediga and Isaac Mogajane in 2009. Together, they produced some of South Africa s best known television shows, including the Emmy nominated Late Nite News with Loyiso Gola. Despite his unexpected death at 33, his legacy will live on through the projects he developed. The creative industry of South Africa has lost a true pioneer. His work reflects that he had a firmly lodged kindness, devilish humour and a strong sense of purpose. Volmink is survived by his wife, Kristie, and their daughter Hannah.
