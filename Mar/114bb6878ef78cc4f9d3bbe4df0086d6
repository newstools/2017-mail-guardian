Bonginkosi Khanyile, the last&nbsp;Fees Must Fall activist in custody, petitioned the&nbsp;Constitutional Court&nbsp;to release him on bail after being held for nearly six&nbsp;months. It granted the&nbsp;Durban University of Technology student&nbsp;R250 bail&nbsp;on condition that he does not intimidate staff or obstruct police l.Hundreds of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters gathered outside the ConCourt on Wednesday morning in support of Khanyile.&nbsp;University of&nbsp;the Witwatersrand&nbsp;EFF chairperson Koketso Phoho&nbsp;said they came to court to stand up against what he called &#8220;student victimisation&#8221;.Phoho believed Khanyile should have been released months ago. Other student leaders such as Mcebo Dlamini of the University of the Witwatersrand and Masixole Mlandu of the University of Cape Town were released after their arrests, he said.&#8220;There is nothing outstanding about this case. It&#8217;s just that the courts wanted to make an example out of it,&#8221; Phoho said.He said Khanyile&#8217;s arrest should send a message about the struggle for free education.Khanyile was arrested with 28 other people on February 4 2016 on various charges related to the countrywide fees protests. The next day he was granted bail, with conditions, but was arrested again on September 27 during further protests. He&nbsp;is facing eight charges including public violence &nbsp;damage to property&nbsp;and inciting violence.Two bail applications at the Durban Magistrate&#8217;s Court were refused, as was an appeal in the high court in Pietermaritzburg. He then applied for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal, which was rejected. -&nbsp;News24
