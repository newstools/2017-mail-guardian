Earthlife Africa Johannesburg declared a major victory on Wednesday after winning&nbsp;South Africa&#8217;s first climate change case and forcing the government to reassess the impact of a coal power plant.The group successfully challenged a government decision to confirm the construction of a proposed coal-fired power station, arguing that the proper climate change impact assessment had not been carried out.Environmental Affairs&nbsp;Minister Edna Molewa accepted that the impact of the proposed Thabametsi power plant had not been &#8220;comprehensively assessed or considered&#8221;, but granted environmental approval anyway, according to the ruling seen by AFP.North Gauteng High Court&nbsp;Judge John Murphy ordered the environmental affairs ministry to complete a climate change assessment before construction of the plant, due to be built in Limpopo, can proceed.Earthlife Africa spokesperson Makoma Lekalakala said the ruling sent &#8220;a very strong message to government and to locals to take part in consultation before any decision takes place&#8221;.&#8220;It is a landmark ruling that actually holds the environmental affairs&nbsp;department to account,&#8221; she added. -&nbsp;Agence France-Presse
