One of Popo Molefe&#8217;s last acts as Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) chairperson was to send a scathing letter to Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza over his unit&#8217;s alleged failure to probe suspicious tenders worth billions of rand.On WednesdayTransport Minister Dipuo Peters dissolved Prasa&#8217;s board.&nbsp;Molefe told eNCA that&nbsp;he had not received a letter from Peters informing him of the decision.&nbsp;He claimed that the dissolution of the board&nbsp;was &#8220;a move to shield Collins Letsoalo&#8221;, the acting chief executive who has refused to quit despite a decision by the board on February 27.News24 has obtained a letter Molefe sent to Ntlemeza on February 13, in which the former Prasa chairperson says the Hawks &#8220;failed to comply with its constitutional and statutory obligations to investigate these matters [the allegedly crooked contracts] and to bring the investigations to finality&#8221;.Following the axing of Prasa chief&nbsp;executive&nbsp;Lucky Montana&nbsp;in July 2015, the Prasa board laid criminal complaints relating to tenders worth more than R7-billion awarded during his tenure.The most significant of these were contracts worth R4-billion awarded to local technology firm Siyangena Technologies and a R3.5-billion tender for the acquisition of locomotives found to be unsuitable for South Africa&#8217;s rail network.Pressure In his letter to Ntlemeza, Molefe describes the contracts as involving &#8220;substantial amounts of public monies&#8221;.The investigations &#8220;relate to tender irregularities and associated unlawful activity that has a detrimental effect on public transport delivery affecting South Africans nationally and concern the diversion of substantial amounts of public monies for personal gain and corruption&#8221;.Molefe accuses the Hawks of having stalled the probes, despite having access to a multitude of information and evidence about alleged corruption and other transgressions sprouting from the tenders.&#8220;In light of the nature of the matters, I am deeply concerned that South African citizens and the fiscus are prejudiced by the fact that the DPCI [Hawks] has done nothing tangible to respond effectively to these matters, despite Prasa&#8217;s ongoing co-operation and assistance,&#8221; Molefe wrote.It appears the purpose of Molefe&#8217;s letter was to force the Hawks to provide Prasa with an update on the two probes.Molefe wanted Ntlemeza &#8220;to advise [Prasa] within seven days&#8221; about &#8220;the number and identities of [the] investigating officers and DPCI officials ... assigned to each matter&#8221; and &#8220;the identity of the person or persons under whose command the teams are working&#8221;. -&nbsp;News24
