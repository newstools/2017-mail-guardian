Joe Root was stunned by former England captain Michael Vaughan&#8217;s assertion that his side had failed to respect Test cricket during their thumping 340-run defeat by South Africa at Trent Bridge. Ashes-winning skipper Vaughan, now a commentator with BBC Radio&#8217;s Test Match Special, made his stinging comments as England lost seven first-innings wickets for 62 runs to be bowled out in little more than 50 overs for 205 in reply to the Proteas&#8217; 335. Root&#8217;s 78 was the only fifty in a meagre total that left England well behind in the game. &#8220;The England batting has been appalling,&#8221; said Vaughan, who &nbsp;played alongside Root s father Matt at the Sheffield Collegiate Club in Yorkshire and has been a friend of the family since Joe was a boy. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a lack of respect about what the game is,&#8221; said Vaughan, one of the leading Test batsmen of his era. &#8220;They look like they are playing a Twenty20 game. They have this approach of attack, attack, attack. There is no thought or feeling of seeing off a bowler or wearing a team down.&#8221; England&#8217;s second innings was even worse, with Root&#8217;s men bowled out for just 133 in pursuit of a world-record target of 474 with more than a day to spare on Monday as South Africa levelled the four-match series at 1-1. This was England&#8217;s sixth defeat in their last eight Tests and Root, in charge for just the most recent two, was taken aback by mentor Vaughan&#8217;s comments. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfair&#8212;I can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s actually said that. &#8220;We pride ourselves on winning series like this, and unfortunately we&#8217;ve played poorly this week,&#8221; Root added. But the Yorkshireman accepted his side ought to be able to bat in different styles according to the match situation, whatever the individual preferences of particular players. &#8220;We need to make sure we learn quickly ... (so that) if we are in a similar situation (in the third Test) at The Oval, for example, we play it slightly smarter,&#8221; said Root. &#8220;Part of Test cricket is trying to find a balance of both (attack and defence)&#8212;and even if it&#8217;s not your strength, you build it into your natural game,&#8221; he added. &#8220;You have periods where you can absorb a bit of pressure and find the right moment to apply it when chances come along. &#8220;We are capable of doing it and have done it previously, but this wasn&#8217;t a very good example of it.&#8221; Meanwhile the 26-year-old Root, who led England to a 211-run series opening win at Lord&#8217;s in his first Test as skipper, said this huge loss had been a chastening experience.&nbsp; &#8220;I definitely feel older&#8212;it&#8217;s been a tough week,&#8221; he conceded. &#8220;South Africa responded very well from Lord&#8217;s&#8212;and especially with the bat, we didn&#8217;t assess the situation well enough in the first innings. &#8220;After that, we couldn&#8217;t find a way to get back into the game.&#8221; The star batsman added: &#8220;We&#8217;re a side that doesn&#8217;t like giving anything away, and unfortunately today that wasn&#8217;t a fair representation of how good we are as a team.&#8221; By contrast, just about everything went right for Root&#8217;s opposing captain Faf du Plessis, who did not play at Lord&#8217;s following the birth of his first child. &#8220;Pretty much from the toss through to the last ball we bowled, we were in control of the Test match,&#8221; said du Plessis. England number three batsman Gary Ballance, out for just four on Monday, was due to have an X-ray on his left index finger after being struck by a Morne Morkel short ball. Agence France-Presse
