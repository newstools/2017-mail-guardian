It was during the end of school time in 2002. He was at his grandmother&#8217;s house in Soweto, and my sister gave him money to pick up school clothes. He disappeared just like that. My child didn t come home so I looked all over. One day, I was in Hillbrow, it was an orphanage, and I found him. I took him home. But he didn&#8217;t stay, he ran away. I don&#8217;t know why he ran. There was everything inside the shack. The fridge was full, and even the social workers went in there and they saw it&#8217;s not about him being hungry. It&#8217;s been like this. I come back with him and he runs away, until now. It s been long since I ve seen him. Even now, I just go out but I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going to. I didn&#8217;t take a cellphone, I didn&#8217;t take a bag, I didn&#8217;t take anything when I left this morning. He&#8217;s my child. I must know where he is, how he lives. If he doesn&#8217;t want to come back to me, that s okay, but it&#8217;s hard. You know when I&#8217;m eating, and I sleep with the blankets the pain. I can&#8217;t stay without my child. There&#8217;s no woman who can stay without her child. I am both the mother and the father. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I saw him. What I know is that he was a child who didn&#8217;t fail at school. I still have his reports. He was a clever boy. If he s dead, I just want to see his bones then bury them. If the government buried him already, I don t have the money to take out the bones to bury him again. His name is Bongani Philip Mkhumbuza.
